ACM,Fundamental requirements of a machine learning operations platform for industrial metal additive manufacturing,2024,0,"Mutahar Safdar, Padma Polash Paul, Guy Lamouche, Gentry Wood, Max Zimmermann, Florian Hannesen, Christophe Bescond, Priti Wanjara, Yaoyao Fiona Zhao","Computers in Industry (CIIN), Volume 154, Issue C",research-article,"AbstractMetal-based Additive Manufacturing (AM) can realize fully dense metallic components and thus offers an opportunity to compete with conventional manufacturing based on the unique merits possible through layer-by-layer processing. Unsurprisingly, Machine Learning (ML) applications in AM technologies have been increasingly growing in the past several years. The trend is driven by the ability of data-driven techniques to support a range of AM concerns, including in-process monitoring and predictions. However, despite numerous ML applications being reported for different AM concerns, no framework exists to systematically manage these ML models for AM operations in the industry. Moreover, no guidance exists on fundamental requirements to realize such a cross-disciplinary platform. Working with experts in ML and AM, this work identifies the fundamental requirements to realize a Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) platform to support process-based ML models for industrial metal AM (MAM). Project-level activities are identified in terms of functional roles, processes, systems, operations, and interfaces. These components are discussed in detail and are linked with their respective requirements. In this regard, peer-reviewed references to identified requirements are made available. The requirements identified can help guide small and medium enterprises looking to implement ML solutions for AM in the industry. Challenges and opportunities for such a system are highlighted. The system can be expanded to include other lifecycle phases of metallic and non-metallic AM.Highlights •Connecting the status of ML-driven AM research and applications to the development of a platform for industrial deployment.•Identifying AM and ML requirements to develop an MLOps platform for industry.•Detailing functional roles, processes, systems, operations, and interfaces as fundamental components of the MLOps platform.•Bridging the knowledge gap and expertise between the domains of AM and ML to realize the cross-discipline platform.•Referencing peer-reviewed AM and ML research in support of the identified requirements.",,"@article{10.1016/j.compind.2023.104037,

Previous research has developed models to predict freight rail disruptions/disturbances and their associated delay times, in order to better understand the impact of multiple factors on them. However, because these models are built on static datasets, extracting real value from a model in a production environment remains difficult.This paper presents a methodology that demonstrates the potential of MLOps in automating the entire workflow, from data extraction to model deployment for real-time delay predictions in freight rail operations, including good practices of Continuous-Integration, Continuous-Delivery, and Continuous-Training, as well as a tool list for each process.Our research advances the field of railway operations by developing an entire MLOps workflow using data from the freight rail operations of the Luxembourgish National Freight Railway Company over a seventeen-month period. Furthermore, we employed a LightGBM model that had previously performed well in another study. This workflow can be automatically triggered to develop the processes and thus maintain an ML model capable of predicting delay times for CFL Multimodal operations in real-time.Our findings demonstrate that MLOps have the potential to automate the entire process, opening up new avenues for future research in this field. Although the methodology presented is intended to optimise freight rail operations for a specific company, it can be easily transferable to other railway companies or other transportation industries, such as aviation, shipping, and trucking.",,"@article{10.1016/j.engappai.2023.106222,

ACM,Quantitative Decomposition of Prediction Errors Revealing Multi-Cause Impacts: An Insightful Framework for MLOps,2023,0,"Keita Sakuma, Ryuta Matsuno, Yoshio Kameda",CIKM '23: Proceedings of the 32nd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,short-paper,"As machine learning applications expand in various industries, MLOps, which enables continuous model operation and improvement, becomes increasingly significant. Identifying causes of prediction errors, such as low model performance or anomalous samples, and implementing appropriate countermeasures are essential for effective MLOps. Furthermore, quantitatively evaluating each cause's impact is necessary to determine the effectiveness of countermeasures. In this study, we propose a method to quantitatively decompose a single sample's prediction error into contributions from multiple causes. Our method involves four steps: calculating the prediction error, computing metrics related to error causes, using a regression model to learn the relationship between the error and metrics, and applying SHAP to interpret the model's predictions and calculate the contribution of each cause to the prediction error. Numerical experiments with open data show that our method offers valuable insights for model improvement, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.",,"@inproceedings{10.1145/3583780.3615238,

abstract = {As machine learning applications expand in various industries, MLOps, which enables continuous model operation and improvement, becomes increasingly significant. Identifying causes of prediction errors, such as low model performance or anomalous samples, and implementing appropriate countermeasures are essential for effective MLOps. Furthermore, quantitatively evaluating each cause's impact is necessary to determine the effectiveness of countermeasures. In this study, we propose a method to quantitatively decompose a single sample's prediction error into contributions from multiple causes. Our method involves four steps: calculating the prediction error, computing metrics related to error causes, using a regression model to learn the relationship between the error and metrics, and applying SHAP to interpret the model's predictions and calculate the contribution of each cause to the prediction error. Numerical experiments with open data show that our method offers valuable insights for model improvement, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.},

However, there is a new intervenient in the room, which will automate and support all steps of ML system development. Machine Learning Operations (MLOPs) will reduce technical friction, so that the model may move from an idea into production, in the shortest amount of time, and subsequently to market with the least possible risk. In this paper, a detailed review of the impacts of ML on insurance premium forecasting and the influence that MLOPs can have on forecasting outcomes is provided. Furthermore, a comprehensive summary is presented of crucial principles in the insurance industry, which are essential for comprehending the role that MLOPs will play in tailoring and individualizing insurance policies and premiums.},

To ease the development process, continuous pipelines for AI have become an active research area where consolidated and in-depth analysis regarding the terminology, triggers, tasks, and challenges is required.This paper includes a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) where we consolidated 151 relevant formal and informal sources. In addition, nine-semi structured interviews with participants from academia and industry verified and extended the obtained information. Based on these sources, this paper provides and compares terminologies for Development and Operations (DevOps) and Continuous Integration (CI)/Continuous Delivery (CD) for AI, Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), (end-to-end) lifecycle management, and Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning (CD4ML). Furthermore, the paper provides an aggregated list of potential triggers for reiterating the pipeline, such as alert systems or schedules. In addition, this work uses a taxonomy creation strategy to present a consolidated pipeline comprising tasks regarding the continuous development of AI. This pipeline consists of four stages: Data Handling, Model Learning, Software Development and System Operations. Moreover, we map challenges regarding pipeline implementation, adaption, and usage for the continuous development of AI to these four stages.Highlights •Terms for AI and DevOps, CI/CD, MLOps, continuous development lifecycle, CD4ML.•Trigger types for executing the continuous development of AI.•AI pipeline: data handling, model learning, software development, system operations.•Pipeline-specific challenges for continuous AI development.",,"@article{10.1016/j.jss.2023.111615,

Although there is an abundance of literature on VM applications, the context of continuous production has received less attention. Fundamental challenges involved in the application of VM to a continuous process have been overlooked in comparison with intermittent (or batch) processes. Here, we described a real-world VM system for the manufacturing of spandex fiber, focusing on how practical challenges associated with a continuous process, including time synchronization, recirculation process, and autocorrelated features, can be addressed using data analytics.

ACM,Auto-Validate by-History: Auto-Program Data Quality Constraints to Validate Recurring Data Pipelines,2023,0,"Dezhan Tu, Yeye He, Weiwei Cui, Song Ge, Haidong Zhang, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang, Surajit Chaudhuri",KDD '23: Proceedings of the 29th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,research-article,"Data pipelines are widely employed in modern enterprises to power a variety of Machine-Learning (ML) and Business-Intelligence (BI) applications. Crucially, these pipelines are recurring (e.g., daily or hourly) in production settings to keep data updated so that ML models can be re-trained regularly, and BI dashboards refreshed frequently. However, data quality (DQ) issues can often creep into recurring pipelines because of upstream schema and data drift over time. As modern enterprises operate thousands of recurring pipelines, today data engineers have to spend substantial efforts to manually monitor and resolve DQ issues, as part of their DataOps and MLOps practices.

abstract = {Data pipelines are widely employed in modern enterprises to power a variety of Machine-Learning (ML) and Business-Intelligence (BI) applications. Crucially, these pipelines are recurring (e.g., daily or hourly) in production settings to keep data updated so that ML models can be re-trained regularly, and BI dashboards refreshed frequently. However, data quality (DQ) issues can often creep into recurring pipelines because of upstream schema and data drift over time. As modern enterprises operate thousands of recurring pipelines, today data engineers have to spend substantial efforts to manually monitor and resolve DQ issues, as part of their DataOps and MLOps practices.Given the high human cost of managing large-scale pipeline operations, it is imperative that we can automate as much as possible. In this work, we propose Auto-Validate-by-History (AVH) that can automatically detect DQ issues in recurring pipelines, leveraging rich statistics from historical executions. We formalize this as an optimization problem, and develop constant-factor approximation algorithms with provable precision guarantees.

ACM,Testing Challenges of Mobile Augmented Reality Systems,2022,0,,,,"Abstract
Augmented reality systems are ones which insert virtual content into a user's view of the real world, in response to environmental conditions and the user's behavior within that environment. This virtual content can take the form of visual elements such as 2D labels or 3D models, auditory cues, or even haptics; content is generated and updated based on user behavior and environmental conditions, such as the user's location, movement patterns, and the results of computer vision or machine learning operations. AR systems are used to solve problems in a range of domains, from tourism and retail, education and healthcare, to industry and entertainment. For example, apps from Lowe's [82] and Houzz [81] support retail transactions by scanning a user's environment and placing product models into the space, thus allowing the user to preview what the product might look like in her home. AR systems have also proven helpful in such areas as aiding industrial assembly tasks [155, 175], helping users overcome phobias [35], and reviving interest in cultural heritage sites [163].Mobile AR systems are ones which run on portable handheld or wearable devices, such that the user is free to move around their environment without restric- tion. Examples of such devices include smartphones, tablets, and head-mounted dis- plays. This freedom of movement and usage, in combination with the application's reliance on computer vision and machine learning logic to provide core function- ality, make mobile AR applications very difficult to test. In addition, as demand and prevalence of machine learning logic increases, the availability and power of commercially available third-party vision libraries introduces new and easy ways for developers to violate usability and end-user privacy.The goal of this dissertation, therefore, is to understand and mitigate the challenges involved in testing mobile AR systems, given the capabilities of today's commercially available vision and machine learning libraries. We consider three related challenge areas: application behavior during unconstrained usage conditions, general usability, and end-user privacy. To address these challenge areas, we present three research efforts. The first presents a framework for collecting application performance and usability data in the wild. The second explores how commercial vision libraries can be exploited to conduct machine learning operations without user knowledge. The third presents a framework for leveraging the environment itself to enforce privacy and access control policies for mobile AR applications.",,"@phdthesis{10.5555/AAI29067373,

RapidMiner is a widely used software tool for the development and execution of such analytics workflows. Unlike many other algorithm toolkits, it comprises a visual editor that allows the user to design processes on a conceptual level. This conceptual and visual approach helps the user to abstract from the technical details during the development phase and to retain a focus on the core modeling task. The large set of preimplemented data analysis and machine learning operations available in the tool, as well as their logical dependencies, can, however, be overwhelming in particular for novice users.In this work, we present an add-on to the RapidMiner framework that supports the user during the modeling phase by recommending additional operations to insert into the currently developed machine learning workflow. First, we propose different recommendation techniques and evaluate them in an offline setting using a pool of several thousand existing workflows. Second, we present the results of a laboratory study, which show that our tool helps users to significantly increase the efficiency of the modeling process. Finally, we report on analyses using data that were collected during the real-world deployment of the plug-in component and compare the results of the live deployment of the tool with the results obtained through an offline analysis and a replay simulation.",,"@article{10.1145/2852082,

abstract = {Machine learning and data analytics tasks in practice require several consecutive processing steps. RapidMiner is a widely used software tool for the development and execution of such analytics workflows. Unlike many other algorithm toolkits, it comprises a visual editor that allows the user to design processes on a conceptual level. This conceptual and visual approach helps the user to abstract from the technical details during the development phase and to retain a focus on the core modeling task. The large set of preimplemented data analysis and machine learning operations available in the tool, as well as their logical dependencies, can, however, be overwhelming in particular for novice users.In this work, we present an add-on to the RapidMiner framework that supports the user during the modeling phase by recommending additional operations to insert into the currently developed machine learning workflow. First, we propose different recommendation techniques and evaluate them in an offline setting using a pool of several thousand existing workflows. Second, we present the results of a laboratory study, which show that our tool helps users to significantly increase the efficiency of the modeling process. Finally, we report on analyses using data that were collected during the real-world deployment of the plug-in component and compare the results of the live deployment of the tool with the results obtained through an offline analysis and a replay simulation.},

These tasks generally involve object detection and tracking operations that require pre-processing the video through expensive machine learning models. To address this cost, several video query optimizers have recently been proposed. Broadly, these methods trade large reductions in pre-processing cost for increases in query execution cost: during query execution, they apply query-specific machine learning operations over portions of the video dataset. Although video query optimizers reduce the overall cost of executing a single query over large video datasets compared to naive object tracking methods, executing several queries over the same video remains cost-prohibitive; moreover, the high per-query latency makes these systems unsuitable for exploratory analytics where fast response times are crucial. In this paper, we present OTIF, a video pre-processor that efficiently extracts all object tracks from large-scale video datasets. By integrating several optimizations under a joint parameter tuning framework, OTIF is able to extract all object tracks from video as fast as existing video query optimizers can execute just one single query. In contrast to the outputs of video query optimizers, OTIF's outputs are general-purpose object tracks that can be used to execute many queries with sub-second latencies.

However, this adoption has not brought the expected results to companies so far. There are several reasons that make Artificial Intelligence solutions particularly complicated to adopt by businesses, such as the knowledge gap between the data science and operations teams. In this paper, we tackle the operationalization of distributed analytical pipelines in heterogeneous production environments, which span across different computational layers. In particular, we present a system called Orfeon, which can leverage different objectives and yields an optimized deployment for these pipelines. In addition, we offer the mathematical formulation of the problem alongside the objectives in hand (i.e. resilience, performance, and cost). Next, we propose a scenario utilizing cloud and edge infrastructural devices, in which we demonstrate how the system can optimize these objectives, without incurring scalability issues in terms of time nor memory. Finally, we compare the usefulness of Orfeon with a variety of tools in the field of machine learning operationalization and conclude that it is able to outperform these tools under the analyzed criteria, making it an appropriate system for the operationalization of machine learning pipelines.Highlights •Orfeon is envisioned to raise the success of ML projects in production environments.•The metric shipper can gather performance ML metrics in distributed environments.•The system optimizes the benefits of the devices in different computational layers.•The mathematical formulation enables the goal-driven deployment of ML projects.•Existing technologies are seamlessly integrated into the operationalization workflow.",,"@article{10.1016/j.future.2022.10.008,

ACM,A Computer Vision-Based Water Level Monitoring System for Touchless and Sustainable Water Dispensing,2023,0,"Andrea Felicetti, Marina Paolanti, Rocco Pietrini, Adriano Mancini, Primo Zingaretti, Emanuele Frontoni",Image Analysis and Processing – ICIAP 2023,Article,"AbstractIn recent years, the need for contactless and sustainable systems has become increasingly relevant. The traditional water dispensers, which require contact with the dispenser and often involve single-use plastic cups or bottles, are not only unhygienic but also contribute to environmental pollution. This paper presents a touchless water dispenser system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to control the dispensing of water or any liquid beverage. The system is designed to fill a container under the nozzle, dispense water when the container is aligned with the flow, and stop dispensing when the container is full, all without requiring any physical contact. This approach ensures compliance with hygiene regulations and promotes environmental sustainability by eliminating the need for plastic bottles or cups, making it a “plastic-free” and “zero waste” system. The prototype is based on a computer vision approach that employs an RGB camera and a Raspberry Pi board, which allows for real-time image processing and machine learning operations. The system uses image processing techniques to detect the presence of a container under the nozzle and then utilizes AI algorithms to control the flow of liquid. The system is trained using machine learning models and optimized to ensure accuracy and efficiency. We discuss the development and implementation of the touchless water dispenser system, including the hardware and software components used, the algorithms employed, and the testing and evaluation of the system. The results of our experiments show that the touchless water dispenser system is highly accurate and efficient, and it offers a safe and sustainable alternative to traditional water dispensers.

ACM,Parallelizing Automatic Model Management System for AIOps on Microservice Platforms,2021,0,"Ruibo Chen, Wenjun Wu",Euro-Par 2021: Parallel Processing Workshops,Article,"AbstractWith the gradual increase in the scale of applications based on microservice architecture, the complexity of system operation and maintenance is also significantly increasing. The emergence of AIOps makes it possible to automatically detect the state, allocate the resources, warn and detect the anomaly of the system through some machine learning models. Given dynamic online workloads, the running state of a production microservice system is constantly in flux. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously train, encapsulate and deploy models based on the current system status, so that the AIOps model can dynamically adapt to the system environment. To address this problem, this paper proposes a model management pipeline framework for AIOps on microservice platforms, and implements a prototype system based on Kubernetes to verify the framework. The system consists of three components: model training, model packaging and model deploying. Parallelization and parameter search are introduced in the model training process to support rapid training of multiple models and automated model hyperparameter tuning.

However, it remains challenging to carry the well-trained deep models for online real-time inference serving, with respect to the time-varying web-scale traffics from billions of users, in a cost-effective manner. In this work, we present JIZHI - a Model-as-a-Service system - that per second handles hundreds of millions of online inference requests to huge deep models with more than trillions of sparse parameters, for over twenty real-time recommendation services at Baidu, Inc. In JIZHI, the inference workflow of every recommendation request is transformed to a Staged Event-Driven Pipeline (SEDP), where each node in the pipeline refers to a staged computation or I/O intensive task processor. With traffics of real-time inference requests arrived, each modularized processor can be run in a fully asynchronized way and managed separately. Besides, JIZHI introduces the heterogeneous and hierarchical storage to further accelerate the online inference process by reducing unnecessary computations and potential data access latency induced by ultra-sparse model parameters. Moreover, an intelligent resource manager has been deployed to maximize the throughput of JIZHI over the shared infrastructure by searching the optimal resource allocation plan from historical logs and fine-tuning the load shedding policies over intermediate system feedback.

abstract = {In modern internet industries, deep learning based recommender systems have became an indispensable building block for a wide spectrum of applications, such as search engine, news feed, and short video clips. However, it remains challenging to carry the well-trained deep models for online real-time inference serving, with respect to the time-varying web-scale traffics from billions of users, in a cost-effective manner. In this work, we present JIZHI - a Model-as-a-Service system - that per second handles hundreds of millions of online inference requests to huge deep models with more than trillions of sparse parameters, for over twenty real-time recommendation services at Baidu, Inc. In JIZHI, the inference workflow of every recommendation request is transformed to a Staged Event-Driven Pipeline (SEDP), where each node in the pipeline refers to a staged computation or I/O intensive task processor. With traffics of real-time inference requests arrived, each modularized processor can be run in a fully asynchronized way and managed separately. Besides, JIZHI introduces the heterogeneous and hierarchical storage to further accelerate the online inference process by reducing unnecessary computations and potential data access latency induced by ultra-sparse model parameters. Moreover, an intelligent resource manager has been deployed to maximize the throughput of JIZHI over the shared infrastructure by searching the optimal resource allocation plan from historical logs and fine-tuning the load shedding policies over intermediate system feedback. Extensive experiments have been done to demonstrate the advantages of JIZHI from the perspectives of end-to-end service latency, system-wide throughput, and resource consumption. Since launched in July 2019, JIZHI has helped Baidu saved more than ten million US dollars in hardware and utility costs per year while handling 200\% more traffics without sacrificing the inference efficiency.},

ACM,Predicting Opioid Use Outcomes in Minoritized Communities,2023,0,"Abhay Goyal, Nimay Parekh, Lam Yin Cheung, Koustuv Saha, Frederick L Altice, Robin O'Hanlon, Roger Ho Chun Man, Chunki Fong, Christian Poellabauer, Honoria Guarino, Pedro Mateu Gelabert, Navin Kumar","BCB '23: Proceedings of the 14th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics",abstract,"Within the healthcare space, machine learning algorithms can sometimes exacerbate racial, ethnic, and gender disparities, among others. Many machine learning algorithms are trained on data from majority populations, thereby generating less accurate or reliable results for minoritized groups [3]. For example, in a widely used algorithm, at a given risk score, the technique falsely concludes that Black individuals are healthier than equally sick White individuals [6]. Thus, such large-scale algorithms can often perpetuate biases. There has been limited work at exploring potential biases in algorithms deployed within minoritized communities. In particular, minimal research has detailed how biases may manifest in algorithms developed by insurance companies to predict opioid use outcomes, or opioid overdoses among people who use opioids in urban areas. An algorithm trained on data from white individuals may provide incorrect estimates for Hispanic/Latino individuals, perhaps resulting in adverse health outcomes.
Since predicting opioid use outcomes is important to improving health in populations often neglected by larger health systems [4], our goal is to examine how machine learning algorithms perform at determining opioid use outcomes within minoritized communities. As a case study, we used data from a sample of 539 young adults who engaged in nonmedical use of prescription opioids and/or heroin [5]. The prevalence and incidence of opioid use has increased rapidly in the US in the past two decades, which is related to concomitant increases in opioid dependence, accidental overdose and death. We addressed the indicated issues through the following contributions: 1) Using machine learning techniques, we predicted opioid use outcomes for participants in our dataset; 2) We assessed if an algorithm trained on a majority sub-sample e.g., Non-Hispanic/Latino, male, could accurately predict opioid use outcomes for a minoritized subsample e.g., Latino, female. Our analysis was conducted to replicate possible real-world scenarios, and provide insight on how to improve broad health outcomes via predictive modeling. For example, if an insurance company primarily caters to Non-Hispanic/Latino individuals, models trained on data from Non-Hispanic/Latino individuals may not predict life insurance costing accurately for Hispanic individuals seeking treatment, and our analysis can provide understanding into such scenarios.
Results indicated that models were able to predict recent injection drug use and participation in drug treatment. The presence of peers who also engaged in opioid use appeared to play a role in predicting drug treatment and injection drug use. However, the available data lacked comprehensive information on other facets of opioid use, such as harm reduction. We noted a decrease in precision when we trained our models on only data from a majority sub-sample, and tested these models on a minoritized sub-sample. Overall, machine learning approaches are only as precise and useful as the data they are trained on, and to make valid and accurate predictions they must be trained on data from people who are similar in terms of key sociodemographic characteristics as the populations about whom predictions will be made. Key to mitigating biases in models to predict health outcomes within minoritized communities, is the inclusion of stakeholders at every stage of the machine learning operations (MLOps) pipeline. For example, methadone patients need to be involved in the development of models to predict methadone dropout risk [1, 2]. Similarly, a committee of ethnic minority individuals can be involved in auditing algorithms used to detect cardiovascular risk. Insurance companies and other stakeholders who use machine learning to predict opioid use outcomes need to be aware that models can exacerbate biases, and seek to improve their predictive modelling capabilities. Insurance companies that have primarily white individuals in their datasets should seek to augment their datasets with individuals from minoritized backgrounds. Such practices can aid providers in making accurate predictions if their client demographics shift, or if nonwhite individuals seek treatment. There increasingly exist independent corporations that audit large scale machine learning models, and such corporations need to ensure that minoritized communities are adequately represented within the audit committee.",,"@inproceedings{10.1145/3584371.3613023,

Efraimidis","Computer Networks: The International Journal of Computer and Telecommunications Networking (CNTW), Volume 235, Issue C",research-article,"AbstractCellular traffic prediction is of great importance on the path of enabling 5G mobile networks to perform intelligent and efficient infrastructure planning and management. However, available data are limited to base station logging information. Hence, training methods for generating high-quality predictions that can generalize to new observations across diverse parties are in demand. Traditional approaches require collecting measurements from multiple base stations, transmitting them to a central entity and conducting machine learning operations using the acquire data. The dissemination of local observations raises concerns regarding confidentiality and performance, which impede the applicability of machine learning techniques. Although various distributed learning methods have been proposed to address this issue, their application to traffic prediction remains highly unexplored. In this work, we investigate the efficacy of federated learning applied to raw base station LTE data for time-series forecasting. We evaluate one-step predictions using five different neural network architectures trained with a federated setting on non-identically distributed data. Our results show that the learning architectures adapted to the federated setting yield equivalent prediction error to the centralized setting. In addition, preprocessing techniques on base stations enhance forecasting accuracy, while advanced federated aggregators do not surpass simpler approaches. Simulations considering the environmental impact suggest that federated learning holds the potential for reducing carbon emissions and energy consumption. Finally, we consider a large-scale scenario with synthetic data and demonstrate that federated learning reduces the computational and communication costs compared to centralized settings.Highlights •Providing insights on the application of federated learning for a real-world time-series forecasting task.•Identifying the challenges of training federated time-series forecasting models with mixed types of non-iid data.•Discussing the influence of pre-processing on the final prediction accuracy.•Evaluating the applicability and effectiveness of various learning architectures.•Simulating the environmental impact of federated learning compared to traditional centralized learning.•Investigating the effects of different aggregation algorithms on model predictive accuracy.",,"@article{10.1016/j.comnet.2023.109950,

This lack also hinders the possibility of developing Intelligent services on top of LBS architectures. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer Digital Twin-based architecture that aims to enable the development of machine learning-based Intelligent LBS (I-LBS) that are able to adapt, evolve, and perform Continual Learning (CL). The platform uses Digital Twins to ensure physical abstraction and provide cyber–physical knowledge to the I-LBSs, which is defined as an execution graph of operation modules. Finally, we simulated a use-case for this platform in the complex scenario of Healthcare organization and management where the I-LBS classifies allowed/not allowed trajectories of users inside a real-existing hospital scenario depending on their role in the organization. The use case is implemented as a Deep Learning-based reconstruction task of high-resolution trajectories processed by the DT architecture that also deploys the I-LBS. The platform is evaluated in terms of physical complexity and computational time on the DT side and on both a traditional machine learning setting and a replay-based CL one for the intelligence side to demonstrate the flexibility and adaptability features introduced by the components for dynamic or unseen scenarios.",,"@article{10.1016/j.engappai.2023.107203,

ACM,Multi-metric Approach for Decomposition of Microservice-Based Data Science Workflows,2023,0,"Christoph Schröer, Sven Wittfoth, Jorge Marx Gómez",Software Architecture. ECSA 2022 Tracks and Workshops,Article,"AbstractTo support fast development cycles in data science, microservice architectures are becoming increasingly important. However, while the design and identification of microservices in transaction-oriented applications are already widely studied, software architects lack support for data science workflows. The identification of microservices for data science workflows differs due to high volume and velocity characteristics.With this work, we aim to present a multi-metric approach for decomposition of microservice-based data science workflows. First, we select different metrics and evaluate their impact on workflow execution under different workload and data conditions. Within the approach, we provide a software architecture that enables microservice architectures to be deployed concurrently in cloud environments considering microservice design patterns such as orchestration of choreography. This architecture can be used to run real-world experiments, aggregate logs and analyze them in an automated way with respect to our chosen metrics. We evaluated our approach using a real-world data science workflow for automated startup assessments.Our work has both practical, theoretical and economic implications. Practically, it can support software architects and data scientists in architecting microservices. In this context, it also has implications for MLOps, as microservices can be used to train and deploy ML models. Theoretically, our software architecture can be used for other research comparing microservice architectures. Economically, we also achieve business impact by looking at the cost of microservice architectures based on service activation time.",,"@inproceedings{10.1007/978-3-031-36889-9_24,

abstract = {To support fast development cycles in data science, microservice architectures are becoming increasingly important. However, while the design and identification of microservices in transaction-oriented applications are already widely studied, software architects lack support for data science workflows. The identification of microservices for data science workflows differs due to high volume and velocity characteristics.With this work, we aim to present a multi-metric approach for decomposition of microservice-based data science workflows. First, we select different metrics and evaluate their impact on workflow execution under different workload and data conditions. Within the approach, we provide a software architecture that enables microservice architectures to be deployed concurrently in cloud environments considering microservice design patterns such as orchestration of choreography. This architecture can be used to run real-world experiments, aggregate logs and analyze them in an automated way with respect to our chosen metrics. We evaluated our approach using a real-world data science workflow for automated startup assessments.Our work has both practical, theoretical and economic implications. Practically, it can support software architects and data scientists in architecting microservices. In this context, it also has implications for MLOps, as microservices can be used to train and deploy ML models. Theoretically, our software architecture can be used for other research comparing microservice architectures. Economically, we also achieve business impact by looking at the cost of microservice architectures based on service activation time.},

Its high adaptability and the ability to learn at runtime are attractive characteristics in microarchitecture settings. However, although hardware RL agents are effective, they suffer from two main problems. First, they have high complexity and storage overhead. This complexity stems from decomposing the environment into a large number of states and then, for each of these states, bookkeeping many action values. Second, many RL agents are engineered for a specific application and are not reusable.  In this work, we tackle both of these shortcomings by designing an RL agent that is both lightweight and reusable across different microarchitecture decision-making problems. We find that, in some of these problems, only a small fraction of the action space is useful in a given time window. We refer to this property as temporal homogeneity in the action space. Motivated by this property, we design an RL agent based on Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms, the simplest form of RL. We call our agent Micro-Armed Bandit.  We showcase our agent in two use cases: data prefetching and instruction fetch in simultaneous multithreaded (SMT) processors. For prefetching, our agent outperforms non-RL prefetchers Bingo and MLOP by 2.6% and 2.3% (geometric mean), respectively, and attains similar performance as the state-of-the-art RL prefetcher Pythia—with the dramatically lower storage requirement of only 100 bytes.

These techniques either completely neglect a prefetcher’s undesirable effects (e.g., memory bandwidth usage) on the overall system, or incorporate system-level feedback as an afterthought to a system-unaware prefetch algorithm. We show that prior prefetchers often lose their performance benefit over a wide range of workloads and system configurations due to their inherent inability to take multiple different types of program context and system-level feedback information into account while prefetching. In this paper, we make a case for designing a holistic prefetch algorithm that learns to prefetch using multiple different types of program context and system-level feedback information inherent to its design. To this end, we propose Pythia, which formulates the prefetcher as a reinforcement learning agent.

Nonetheless, employing CI/CD pipelines in an application that incorporates components of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) has challenging issues, and pioneers in the field settle them with the utilization of exclusive tooling, frequently presented by cloud suppliers. This study gives a higher perspective on the machine learning lifecycle and the vital differences between DevOps and MLOps.

Nowadays, many Machine Learning (ML)-based WAD approaches have been researched and yielded high efficiency. Additionally, to ensure optimal classification performance with data containing new classes, these models are regularly retrained. Nevertheless, the process of retraining models using both old and new data poses significant challenges in terms of computational requirements and storage capacity. On the other hand, when retraining the model with only new data, the model faces the problem of Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) which cannot adequately retain the previously learned amount of knowledge about the old data. To address these problems, in this work, we proposed an Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based WAD together with Incremental Learning (IL) technique, named IncWAD. Besides that, we also designed a Machine Learning Operations (MLOPs) cycle to deploy and manage the ML model conveniently. The evaluation results on the SR-BH 2020 multi-label dataset with various cases indicated that the IncWAD model could correctly classify different types of attacks and achieved an accuracy of more than 95%.",,"@INPROCEEDINGS{10318852,

Deep learning methods are used for load forecasting with different devices for smart grids in advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). Scattered and large amounts of energy consumption data are used for information and communication technologies (ICT) using centralized model training. Therefore, federated learning (FL) shares weights without transmitting data. However, FL requires enough operation time to train multiple nodes. The proposed method in this study used a Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) framework which is lower-cost FL operations on the visual interface. With this method, developers can implement FL conveniently. The experimental results showed that only a small amount of code writing was required to obtain the training results. This greatly reduced the communication cost and computation complexity and improved the efficiency of retraining and code deployment. The productivity of operation, then, can be reduced significantly.",,"@INPROCEEDINGS{10383048,

One of the major challenges for using machine learning in the metaverse is MLOps (Machine Learning Operations), an emerging field that focuses on deploying and managing machine learning models in production. It has been widely acknowledged that machine learning models require a large amount of data to learn and make accurate predictions, and such data is generated progressively in real-time as human users interact with the metaverse. Due to the human-centric nature of the metaverse, it goes without saying that, once deployed, models need to be able to adapt to the constantly changing interactive environment and still make accurate predictions. Borrowing a page from software engineering, in this paper, we explore the design space of human-centric continuous integration in metaverse environments, where labeled data samples accumulated with explicit human interactive behavior (e.g., using virtual reality or augmented reality headsets) are used for fine-tuning a deployed deep learning model over a sustained period of time. We propose SPIN, a new mechanism that efficiently utilizes data samples collected from a large number of participating human users over time to fine-tune a deployed model that is shared across all the users. In an extensive array of experimental results using image classification and state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection models as case studies, we show that SPIN outperforms FedBuff, a state-of-the-art asynchronous FL mechanism from conventional federated learning, by a substantial margin.",,"@ARTICLE{10379159,

The effectiveness of the solution proposed in this work is evaluated by means of a survey-based analysis carried out among researchers who currently use manual processes to perform machine learning experiments. The results indicate that manual processing is prone to errors and not scalable regarding the size and complexity of most experiments.

Previously, Internet of Things (IoT) devices could only collect and send data to the cloud for analysis. However, the increasing computing capacity of todayâ€™s devices allows them to perform complex computations on-device, resulting in edge computing. Edge devices are a fundamental component of modern, distributed real-world artificial intelligence (AI) systems in Industry 4.0 environments. As a result, edge computing extends cloud computing capabilities by bringing services near the edge of a network and thus supports a new variety of AI services and machine learning (ML) applications. However, there is a large difference between designing and training an ML model, potentially in the cloud, to create ML services that can be deployed and consumed on the edge. This article presents an ML workflow based on ML operations (MLOps) over the Thinger.io IoT platform to streamline the transition from model training to model deployment on edge devices. The proposed workflow is composed of different elements, such as the ML training pipeline, ML deployment pipeline, and ML workspace. Similarly, this article describes the ease of design and deployment of the proposed solution in a real environment, where an anomaly detection service is implemented for detecting outliers on temperature and humidity measurements. The performance tests performed over the ML pipeline steps and the ML service throughput on the edge indicate that this workflow adds minimum overhead to the process, providing a more reliable, reusable, and productive environment.",,"@ARTICLE{10107354,

The aggressive expansion of big data and data-intensive computing combined with the onset of Machine-Learning and AI-software as principal components to software systems has forced both practitioners and researchers to look for new ways to cater for increased demands in speed, heterogeneity, and scale of software as a construct and its computing in general. What is more, phenomena such as information explosion and half-life are often compounded by incidents such as COVID, which are becoming more frequent and impactful. It is clear that Data-Intensive compute algorithms-and the people around them-are undergoing massive and continuous changes, at an even higher rate than before and with unprecedented global scale. This talk will address the emerging frontiers of such novel data-intensive continuous computing in combination with emerging AI software demands, starting from an algorithmic perspective and delving into the approaches-both numeric and symbolic-that make such intelligent algorithms continuously evolving, smarter and smarter, as well as explainable and socially sustainable.

Continuous training (CT) automatically retrains ML models, and continuous deployment (CD) automatically deploys the retrained models to production. CT and CD are essential for maintaining ML model performance in dynamic production environments and, therefore, need to be considered when practicing MLOps. We present our CTCD-e MLOps pipeline, implemented mostly using existing open-source software, being able to autonomously adapt an ML system to changing production environments by enabling flexible model CT and CD. The pipeline can automatically trigger a model retraining round when the model performance degrades. Then it automatically conducts an A/B test for the retrained model and its predecessor in production to start serving the better one. The pipeline was evaluated by two experiments. In the pipeline, users can flexibly configure the model retraining, as well as the redeployment and production A/B test of the retrained models based on various requirements.",,"@INPROCEEDINGS{10371612,

In the last decade, the performance of computer vision using trained deep neural networks has outperformed previous approaches based on careful feature engineering. However, the opaqueness of large ML models is a substantial impediment for critical applications such as in the automotive context. As a remedy, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) has been proposed to provide visual explanations of model internals. In this paper, we demonstrate how Grad-CAM heatmaps can be used to increase the explainability of an image recognition model trained for a pedestrian underpass. We argue how the heatmaps support compliance to the EU's seven key requirements for Trustworthy AI. Finally, we propose adding automated heatmap analysis as a pipe segment in an MLOps pipeline. We believe that such a building block can be used to automatically detect if a trained ML-model is activated based on invalid pixels in test images, suggesting biased models.",,"@INPROCEEDINGS{9440142,

FL is gaining attention because it avoids data transfer to the server, facilitating the decentralized learning of the traditional ML model. Despite its potential, FL project is significantly more challenging to develop than centralized ML methods owing to decentralized local data. We propose FedOps, federated learning operations for constructing systematic FL project by enhancing machine learning operations (MLOps) to be effectively applied to FL while preserving its core process. To address complexity of FL implementation, we developed FedOps platform, which involves FedOps-based projects to manage the whole lifecycle in FL context. We also investigated methods to identify performance degradation factors in FL and suggest an approach for improvement. FedOps Platform provides an analysis tool for client heterogeneity, called chunk-bench. This tool enables researchers and engineers to gain insights into systems heterogeneity by using only small chunk of the clients’ data to execute test in the shortest time possible while tracking the systems heterogeneity across the clients. By addressing systems heterogeneity, FedOps Platform achieved 13%–43% improvement in communication cost-to-accuracy and 20%–68% improvement in time-to-accuracy. We believe that FedOps Platform offers an optimal solution for end-to-end development of FL projects, with significantly improving both computational and communication efficiencies.",,"@ARTICLE{10380563,

However, optimizing a machine learning modelâ€™s lifecycle to facilitate efficient resource utilization is still an active area of research. The approach typically involves a manual effort to partition the models into distinct layers and decide how to store these distinct layers on a distributed computing framework. However, distributing distinct layers across nodes can induce a network latency bottleneck in the machine learning pipeline. Further, the above process becomes more inefficient as models become increasingly complex. In this paper, we present a heuristic-based approach to distributed model training.

A multitude of approaches have been proposed in the literature for predicting lead times considering different data and methods or algorithms from operations research (OR) and machine learning (ML). In order to provide guidance at setting up prediction models and developing new approaches, a systematic review of the available approaches for predicting lead times is presented in this paper. Forty-two publications were analyzed and synthetized: Based on a developed framework considering the used data class (e.g. product data or system status), the data origin (master data or real data) and the used method and algorithm from OR and ML, the publications are classified. Based on the classification, a descriptive analysis is performed to identify common approaches in the existing literature as well as implications for further research. One result is, that mostly order data and the status of the production system are used for predicting lead times whereas material data are used seldom. Additionally, ML approaches primarily use artificial neural networks and regression models for predicting lead times, while OR approaches use mainly combinatorial optimization or heuristics. Furthermore, with increasing model complexity the use of real data decreased. Thus, we identified as an implication for further research to set up a complex data model considering material data, which uses real data as data origin.",,"@ARTICLE{9143119,

The multitude of programming languages, libraries and available resources allow them to easily build their own models or algorithms. However, ML models are tightly connected to their data implying a different development process from other types of software. Software projects often rely on version control platforms, such as GitHub, but these platforms have not yet been extended to support ML projects. There is poor support for data versioning and no link between ML and software artifacts. Thus, traceability and model evolution can become challenging for developers. While some specific ML platforms exist, they still require considerable manual specification of ML artifacts and links between them. In this work, we propose a framework for automatic identification and traceability of links between data, code and ML model through Mining Software Repositories (MSR) techniques. Our tool combines static code analysis and mining commit data to identify ML, code and data artifacts, reconstruct links between them and retrieve commits that affect each end of the link.

Often during large-scale disasters, cell towers become overloaded, and the only way of communication is through text messages. It becomes important to gather information from text messages sent to emergency numbers in order to respond quickly and efficiently with life-saving efforts. In addition, responders are unable to manually handle the large volume of incoming texts. To add to this difficult problem, these data sources tend to be microtext. This research developed a methodology to summarize text messages sent during an emergency, including analysis of locations. The real-time disaster needs were then input into a mixed integer programming resource allocation model for distribution of resources for disaster aid. Prior research included resource allocation and text modeling, but the combination of the two is a novel application not only in this arena, but more broadly across domains.",,"@INPROCEEDINGS{6699052,

Designing linear programs (LPs) is a difficult and expensive process, as it requires both mathematical programming and domain expertise, and it involves both designing an objective function and feasibility constraints. To support this design process, we propose INCALP, an algorithm for inducing linear programs from examples. Since the objective can often be learned with standard techniques (e.g. regression), INCALP learns the hard constraints only. It does so by encoding constraint learning as a mixed integer linear program. INCALP achieves significant efficiency gains by considering gradually larger subsets of examples, and terminating as soon as a suitable program is found. In addition, INCALP encourages both compactness and sparsity of the learned program.

We also propose to augment the general life cycle model to include security features to enable building security-in as the development progresses and bolt security-on as flaws are discovered after deployment. Most ML systems today operate in a black-box mode, providing users with only the predictions without associated reasoning as to how the predictions are brought about. There is heavy emphasis now to build mechanisms that help the user develop higher confidence in accepting the predictions of ML systems. Such explainability feature of ML model predictions is a must for critical systems. We also propose to augment our lifecycle model with explainability features.

We conducted a questionnaire-based global survey to explore these topics by analyzing 150 responses from experienced AI, data, and MLOps engineers.The results determined that the stage System Operations is mainly automated. Whereas several tasks from the other three stages (e.g., data cleaning, data quality assurance, model design, model improvement, and system level quality assurance) are more often partially automated than automated, and documentation-related tasks are mostly not automated or developed. Participants required the highest development effort for the stage Data Handling.

 Eric Guerizec",IEEE,Conference Paper,"Continuously learning and serving from evolving streaming data and serving in real-time is a challenging problem. Traditionally, data is partitioned and processed in batches to train machine learning (ML) models. In industrial applications, static modelsâ€™ performance drops over time (model degradation, concept drift), requiring new models to be trained with recent data and redeployed in production. The scientific community has been studying online and adaptive methods to address batch-learning limitations and continuously train AI tasks for industrial applications such as cyber-security, AIOps, anomaly scoring, and drift detection in stock markets. This paper deals with the MLOps aspects of deploying such online and dynamic models to address the requirements in the production systems for real-time applications. Our architectures - based on open-source tools such as Kafka and River - demonstrated how online learning methods could be scaled horizontally in production to meet the demands of a high-velocity streaming pipeline. We demonstrate an MLOps strategy to perform incremental learning from streaming data and continuously deploy the online learning model without pausing the inference pipeline. Indeed, the design satisfies requirements such as model versioning, monitoring, audibility and reproducibility of prediction in both a supervised and semi-supervised setting. Our experiments - for malicious URLs detection task - performed on high-dimensional and feature-evolving streaming data (more than 3 million features) establish the effectiveness and efficiency of online learning models compared to batch (static) machine learning regarding both time and space complexity. Finally, we provide some best practices on data engineering for deploying online models to process a real-time feature stream in production environments. Code is publicly available for reproducibility.",,"@INPROCEEDINGS{10184778,

 Atif Waraich",,,"Pressure ulcers are a challenge for patients and healthcare professionals. In the UK, pressure ulcers affect 700,000 people each year. Treating them costs the National Health Service €3.8 million every day. Their etiology is complex and multifactorial. However, evidence has shown a strong link between old age, disease-related sedentary lifestyles, and unhealthy eating habits. Direct skin contact with a bed or chair without frequent position changes can cause pressure ulcers. Urinary and faecal incontinence, diabetes, and injuries that restrict body position and nutrition are also known risk factors. Guidelines and treatments exist but their implementation and success vary across different healthcare settings. This is primarily because healthcare practitioners have a) minimal experience in dealing with pressure ulcers, and b) a general lack of understanding of pressure ulcer treatments. Poorly managed, pressure ulcers can lead to severe pain, a poor quality of life, and significant healthcare costs. In this paper, we report the findings of a clinical trial conducted by Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust that evaluated the performance of a faster region-based convolutional neural network and mobile platform that categorised and documented pressure ulcers automatically. The neural network classifies category I, II, III, and IV pressure ulcers, deep tissue injuries, and pressure ulcers that are unstageable. District nurses used their mobile phones to take pictures of pressure ulcers and transmit them over 4/5G communications to an inferencing server for classification. The approach uses existing deep learning technologies to provide a novel end-to-end pipeline for pressure ulcer categorisation that works in ad hoc domiciliary settings. The strength of the approach resides within MLOPS, model deployment at scale, and the platforms in-situ operation. While solutions exist in the NHS for analysing pressure ulcers none of them automatically classify and report pressure ulcers from a service users’ residential home automatically. We acknowledge that there is a great deal of work to do, but the approach offers a convincing solution to standardise pressure ulcer categorisation and reporting. The results from the study are encouraging and show that using 216 images, collected over an eight-month trial, it was possible to generate a mean average Precision=0.6796, Recall=0.6997, F1-Score=0.6786 with 45 false positives using an @.75 confidence score threshold.",,"@ARTICLE{10164095,

Although many studies focus on adapting ML software engineering (SE) approaches and techniques, few studies have summarized the status and challenges of operationalizing ML models. Model operationalization encompasses all steps after model training and evaluation, including packaging the model in a format appropriate for deployment, publishing to a model registry or storage, integrating the model into a broader software system, serving, and monitoring. This study is the first systematic literature review investigating the techniques, tools, and infrastructures to operationalize ML models. After reviewing 24 primary studies, the results show that there are a number of tools for most use cases to operationalize ML models and cloud deployment in particular. The review also revealed several research opportunities, such as dynamic model-switching, continuous model-monitoring, and efficient edge ML deployments.

However, deployed models need to be watched and constantly managed, supervised, and debugged to guarantee their availability, validity, and robustness in unexpected situations. Therefore, containerized ML workflows would benefit from leveraging flexible and diverse autonomic capabilities. This work presents an architecture for autonomic ML workflows with abilities for multi-layered control, based on an agent-based approach that enables autonomic management and supervision of ML workflows at the application layer and the infrastructure layer (by collaborating with the orchestrator). We redesign the Scanflow ML framework to support such multi-agent approach by using triggers, primitives, and strategies. We also implement a practical platform, so-called Scanflow-K8s, that enables autonomic ML workflows on Kubernetes clusters based on the Scanflow agents. MNIST image classification and MLPerf ImageNet classification benchmarks are used as case studies to show the capabilities of Scanflow-K8s under different scenarios.

Concept drift is among the open issues preventing the widespread exploitation of deep learning models in real-life settings.

Prediction models, usually trained on static historical data, should be promptly re-trained in case of new real-time drifted data distributions. Although some drift detection methodologies have been proposed over the years, different issues are still open since state-of-the-art solutions show limited effectiveness and efficiency.This paper proposes Drift Lens, a novel real-time unsupervised per-label drift detection methodology based on embedding distribution distances in deep learning models.

We think that this is an important gap to fill for two main reasons: (1) in the near future, every application will be infused with some sort of ML capability; (2) behind every web page, application, and enterprise there is a DBMS, whereby in-DBMS inference is an appealing solution both for efficiency (e.g., less data movement), performance (e.g., cross-optimizations between relational operators and ML) and governance. In this article, we study whether DBMSs are a good fit for prediction serving. We introduce a technique for translating trained ML pipelines containing both featurizers (e.g., one-hot encoding) and models (e.g., linear and tree-based models) into SQL queries, and we compare in-DBMS performance against popular ML frameworks such as Sklearn and ml.net . Our experiments show that, when pushed inside a DBMS, trained ML pipelines can have performance comparable to ML frameworks in several scenarios, while they perform quite poorly on text featurization and over (even simple) neural networks.",,"@ARTICLE{10107490,

To address this issue, several ML pipelines have emerged with the goal of creating development environments which facilitate the deployment, evaluation and maintenance. In this paper, we advocate that most existing pipelines are not well suited for the initial stages of ML development, due to their high setup and maintenance overheads. As such, we propose a lightweight Quick Machine Learning framework, QML, which is capable of reducing the setup overhead and operating in the low infrastructure environments that are most common-place in experimental ML projects. To demonstrate QML's usefulness, we present a case-study where a lightweight ML pipeline was developed, and subsequently validated on a standard ML classification problem. Lastly, we assess the differences between our pipeline and an alternative lightweight workflow, based on DAGsHub. With this comparison, we conclude that our approach increases ML task automation as well as feature support, while falling short only in the Experiment Tracking category.

 Imane Boudellioua",IEEE,Conference Paper,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning significantly improve many sectors, such as education, healthcare, and industry. Machine learning techniques mainly depend on the volume and diversity of training data. With the digital transformation we live in, an abundant amount of data can be collected from different sources. However, the problem that needs to be addressed is how this amount of data can be processed and where it can be stored. Cloud services and distributed file systems (DFSs) help address this issue. Many DFSs such as Hadoop, Quantcast, and Apache Spark differ in many aspects, including scheduling algorithms, data management protocol, throughput, and runtime. Some DFSs may be better for working with specific applications than others. Apache Spark is capable of handling iterative operations like machine learning operations as well as it provides an integrated library of different machine learning algorithms called MLlib. In this paper, we evaluated the use of Spark using two machine learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forests (RF). We investigated the effect of varying the memory allocation configuration and the use of GPU. We concluded that the use of Spark greatly improves the runtime and memory consumption. However, its use has to be justifiable and needed for the size of the data due to different factors that affect the machine learning model's accuracy. The memory allocation should be kept to the minimum needed, and GPU should only be used when the machine learning algorithm used supports parallelization.",,"@INPROCEEDINGS{10008282,

This paper proposes a two-stage DDoS attack detection algorithm combining time series-based multi-dimensional sketch and machine learning technologies. Besides packet numbers, total lengths, and protocols, we construct the time series-based multi-dimensional sketch with limited space cost by storing elephant flow information with the Boyer-Moore voting algorithm and hash index. For the first stage of detection, we adopt CNN to generate sketch-level DDoS attack detection results from the time series-based multi-dimensional sketch. For the sketch with potential DDoS attacks, we use RNN with flow information extracted from the sketch to implement flow-level DDoS attack detection in the second stage. Experimental results show that not only is the detection accuracy of our proposed method much close to that of packet-level DDoS attack detection methods based on machine learning, but also the computational time cost of our method is much smaller with regard to the number of machine learning operations.",,"@INPROCEEDINGS{9919958,

Companies make huge profits out of the analysis and predictions they make. ML Engineers are highly paid for their knowledge in this domain. It has become prevalent and much more comprehensible. One best out of the important stages in ML is Data preprocessing, and feature extraction. In Data Preprocessing itself, there are various tasks one needs to perform accurately to make the data provided. From handling missing values to encoding and normalization, each step has its importance and hence a professional must be adept with each of these steps. Data Preprocessing steps depend upon the type of data provided i.e. categorical data, continuous data, an array of images' pixels or even images themselves. With the requirement to deal with all the cleaning steps, it becomes quite strenuous to learn and become an expert. Moreover, it is time-consuming and does not guarantee expected results. Hence, there is a need to handle this issue. We aim to automate this complete process to ease the work of Machine Learning Engineers and make it more productive. Any user will only have to provide the dataset and does not have to manually select the processing techniques as provided by the latest Data Mining tools. The application will observe the dataset and apply the suitable techniques on its own. Since all the steps will be automated and the user will only have to provide the dataset, even the people who are not familiar with concepts of Machine Learning can pre-process the dataset.

The problem of interest is selection of X so as to maximize the number of constraints that are simultaneously satisfied, or equivalently, combinatorial selection of a maximum cardinality subset of feasible inequalities. Special classes of this problem are of interest in a variety of areas such as pattern recognition, machine learning, operations research, and medical treatment planning. This problem is generally solvable in exponential time. A heuristic polynomial time algorithm is presented in this paper. The algorithm relies on an iterative constraint removal procedure where constraints are eliminated from a set proposed by solutions to minmax linear programs.

Thus, performing large-scale machine learning operations with the distributed datasets through communication networks is often required. In this paper, we study the convergence rate of the distributed dual coordinate ascent for distributed machine learning problems in a general tree-structured network. Since a tree network model can be understood as the generalization of a star network, our algorithm can be thought of as the generalization of the distributed dual coordinate ascent in a star network. We provide the convergence rate of the distributed dual coordinate ascent over a general tree network in a recursive manner and analyze the network effect on the convergence rate. Secondly, by considering network communication delays, we optimize the distributed dual coordinate ascent algorithm to maximize its convergence speed. From our analytical result, we can choose the optimal number of local iterations depending on the communication delay severity to achieve the fastest convergence speed. In numerical experiments, we consider machine learning scenarios over communication networks, where local workers cannot directly reach to a central node due to constraints in communication, and demonstrate that the usability of our distributed dual coordinate ascent algorithm in tree networks.",,"@ARTICLE{9427236,

Hardware acceleration is one approach to improve the pipeline performance and free up processor resources by offloading computations to the accelerators. However, the performance benefits of accelerators can be limited by the compute and data offloading overheads. Although prior works have studied acceleration opportunities, including with accelerators for machine learning operations, an end-to-end application performance analysis has not been well studied, particularly for data analytics and model scoring pipelines. In this paper, we study speedups and overheads of using PCIe-based hardware accelerators in such pipelines. In particular, we analyze the effectiveness of using GPUs and FPGAs to accelerate scoring for random forest, a popular machine learning model, on tabular input data obtained from Microsoft SQL Server. We observe that the offloading decision as well as the choice of the optimal hardware backend should depend at least on the model complexity (e.g., number of features and tree depth), the scoring data size, and the overheads associated with data movement and invocation of the pipeline stages. We also highlight potential future research explorations based on our findings.",,"@INPROCEEDINGS{9408191,

For example, in autonomous driving, an object classification model should achieve high detection rates under different conditions of weather, distance, etc. Similarly, in the financial setting, credit-scoring models must not discriminate against minority groups. These conditions or groups are called as â€œ Data Slices â€. In product MLOps cycles, product developers must identify such critical data slices and adapt models to mitigate data slice problems. Discovering where models fail, understanding why they fail, and mitigating these problems, are therefore essential tasks in the MLOps life-cycle. In this paper, we present SliceTeller , a novel tool that allows users to debug, compare and improve machine learning models driven by critical data slices. SliceTeller automatically discovers problematic slices in the data, helps the user understand why models fail. More importantly, we present an efficient algorithm, SliceBoosting , to estimate trade-offs when prioritizing the optimization over certain slices. Furthermore, our system empowers model developers to compare and analyze different model versions during model iterations, allowing them to choose the model version best suitable for their applications. We evaluate our system with three use cases, including two real-world use cases of product development , to demonstrate the power of SliceTeller in the debugging and improvement of product-quality ML models.",,"@ARTICLE{9906903,

Many types of technological problems that were once considered prohibitively expensive to tackle are now candidates for exploration. Machine Learning (ML) tools that were valued only in academic environments are quickly being embraced by industrial giants and tiny startups alike. Coupled with modern-day computing power, ML tools can be looked at as hammers that can deal with even the most stubborn nails. ML tools have become so ubiquitous that the current industrial expectation is that they should not only deliver accurate and intelligent solutions but also do so rapidly. In order to keep pace with these requirements, a new enterprise, referred to as MLOps has blossomed in recent years. MLOps combines the process of ML and DS with an agile software engineering technique to develop and deliver solutions in a fast and iterative way. One of the key challenges to this is that ML and DS tools should be efficient and have better usability characteristics than were traditionally offered. In this paper, we present a novel software for Grammatical Evolution (GE) that meets both of these expectations. Our tool, GELAB, is a toolbox for GE in Matlab which has numerous features that distinguish it from existing contemporary GE software. Firstly, it is user-friendly and its development was aimed for use by non-specialists. Secondly, it is capable of hybrid optimization, in which standard numerical optimization techniques can be added to GE. We have shown experimentally that when hybridized with meta-heuristics GELAB has an overall better performance as compared with standard GE.",,"@ARTICLE{9751757,

Our aims were to decipher spatial variations in OP fractions and to clarify the effects of leaching on these variations along the altitudinal gradient (2628, 2781, 3044 and 3210?m?a.s.l.) on Mt. Gongga, southwest China. The results showed that the stocks of total OP (TOP) and moderately resistant OP (MROP) increased roughly upslope, with their minimums (824.69 and 410.56?kg?ha?1, respectively) at 2781?m. The concentrations and stocks of labile OP (LOP) markedly increased with altitude. The stocks of moderately labile OP (MLOP) and highly resistant OP (HROP) did not vary significantly among the four sites. The TOP distribution was likely related to the decrease of mineralization rate caused by the decreasing temperature upslope, and also disturbed by the leaching process. In addition, distributions of other P fractions were also regulated by this process. A larger loss of bioavailable P (Bio-P) occurred at the lower altitudes (2628 and 2781?m) due to more intensive leaching. This larger loss was compensated by microbial processes, as sharp decline in microbial biomass P and intensive mineralization of LOP via higher enzyme activities were observed. The MLOP and MROP were the main OP fractions that were downward migrated with fulvic acids, amorphous Fe and Al. The results highlight the role of leaching in regulating distributions of OP and Bio-P along altitudinal gradients in montane ecosystems.",,"@article{HE2018144,

abstract = {Little information is available about the leaching effects on the altitudinal distribution of soil organic phosphorus (OP), even though this process commonly occurs in most humid montane. Our aims were to decipher spatial variations in OP fractions and to clarify the effects of leaching on these variations along the altitudinal gradient (2628, 2781, 3044 and 3210‚ÄØm‚ÄØa.s.l.) on Mt. Gongga, southwest China. The results showed that the stocks of total OP (TOP) and moderately resistant OP (MROP) increased roughly upslope, with their minimums (824.69 and 410.56‚ÄØkg‚ÄØha‚àí1, respectively) at 2781‚ÄØm. The concentrations and stocks of labile OP (LOP) markedly increased with altitude. The stocks of moderately labile OP (MLOP) and highly resistant OP (HROP) did not vary significantly among the four sites. The TOP distribution was likely related to the decrease of mineralization rate caused by the decreasing temperature upslope, and also disturbed by the leaching process. In addition, distributions of other P fractions were also regulated by this process. A larger loss of bioavailable P (Bio-P) occurred at the lower altitudes (2628 and 2781‚ÄØm) due to more intensive leaching. This larger loss was compensated by microbial processes, as sharp decline in microbial biomass P and intensive mineralization of LOP via higher enzyme activities were observed. The MLOP and MROP were the main OP fractions that were downward migrated with fulvic acids, amorphous Fe and Al. The results highlight the role of leaching in regulating distributions of OP and Bio-P along altitudinal gradients in montane ecosystems.}

SD,Nutritional composition and consumer acceptability of Moringa oleifera leaf powder (MOLP)-supplemented mahewu,2019,45,"R.N. Olusanya a, U. Kolanisi a b, A. van Onselen c, N.Z. Ngobese d, M.

Mahewu, a non-alcoholic cereal grain beverage, is prepared in many rural settings in southern Africa by fermenting maize meal porridge. People of all age groups, including infants, consume mahewu. However, the drink is deficient in essential amino acids and some micronutrients. This study investigated the effects of adding Moringa oleifera leaf powder (MOLP) on the nutritional composition and consumer acceptability of mahewu. Moringa oleifera leaf powder-supplemented mahewu was prepared by substituting a portion of the maize meal used in a traditional recipe with MOLP at 2, 4 and 6% (w/w) levels. The MOLP was boiled and added to the fermented porridge (mahewu) prior to consumption. The nutritional composition of the resulting mahewu samples and standard traditional mahewu were analyzed using AOAC methods. Sensory evaluation was conducted using (n?=?52) untrained panelists who rated the samples on a 5-point hedonic scale. Adding MOLP resulted in a significant (p?<?.05) increase in the total mineral content (ash), selected mineral elements, fat and fiber content of the beverage. The Calcium content increased by 350, 700 and 950% in mahewu samples supplemented with 2, 4 and 6% MOLP, respectively.

Mehedi Hasan f, Md. Abu Baten g",Journal of Information and Intelligence,article,"AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) is an emerging field that aims to automate the process of building machine learning models. AutoML emerged to increase productivity and efficiency by automating as much as possible the inefficient work that occurs while repeating this process whenever machine learning is applied. In particular, research has been conducted for a long time on technologies that can effectively develop high-quality models by minimizing the intervention of model developers in the process from data preprocessing to algorithm selection and tuning. In this semantic review research, we summarize the data processing requirements for AutoML approaches and provide a detailed explanation. We place greater emphasis on neural architecture search (NAS) as it currently represents a highly popular sub-topic within the field of AutoML. NAS methods use machine learning algorithms to search through a large space of possible architectures and find the one that performs best on a given task. We provide a summary of the performance achieved by representative NAS algorithms on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet and well-known benchmark datasets.

abstract = {AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) is an emerging field that aims to automate the process of building machine learning models. AutoML emerged to increase productivity and efficiency by automating as much as possible the inefficient work that occurs while repeating this process whenever machine learning is applied. In particular, research has been conducted for a long time on technologies that can effectively develop high-quality models by minimizing the intervention of model developers in the process from data preprocessing to algorithm selection and tuning. In this semantic review research, we summarize the data processing requirements for AutoML approaches and provide a detailed explanation. We place greater emphasis on neural architecture search (NAS) as it currently represents a highly popular sub-topic within the field of AutoML. NAS methods use machine learning algorithms to search through a large space of possible architectures and find the one that performs best on a given task. We provide a summary of the performance achieved by representative NAS algorithms on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet and well-known benchmark datasets. Additionally, we delve into several noteworthy research directions in NAS methods including one/two-stage NAS, one-shot NAS and joint hyperparameter with architecture optimization. We discussed how the search space size and complexity in NAS can vary depending on the specific problem being addressed. To conclude, we examine several open problems (SOTA problems) within current AutoML methods that assure further investigation in future research.}

Flammable and poisonous gases significantly contribute to many fatal accidents. This study proposes a real-time-based reliable gas hazard monitoring system using multisensor data fusion. A hybrid of CNN-LSTM-based deep neural network (HCLM) is developed to serve the purpose. Due to the challenging environment of the UCM, sensor malfunctioning is inevitable and severely affects the performance of HCLM. A novel front-end filter (FEF) is developed based on Damper Shafer's (DS) theory and belief divergence-based weighted credibility metric to overcome the drawback of HCLM. In the laboratory trial, it is observed that the hazard classification accuracy of HCLM for the faulty node scenarios is 85%. In contrast, the accuracy of the HCLM integrated with FEF is maintained at 98%, even for multiple faulty node cases. Another novelty of this study is the tinyML implementation of the proposed model. Due to UCM's inherent complexities and challenges, traditional wireless communications face operational difficulties. Hence, a cloud-based machine learning operation is not a feasible option in UCM. Hence, using the concept of tinyML, the proposed model is directly deployed on a microcontroller near the data sources, thereby reducing network latency and security issues.  © 2014 IEEE.",,"@ARTICLE{Sharma20243264,

Embracing digitalization in subsurface helps to improve accuracy, reduce risks, and accelerate cycle time. Crew change, availability of high-precision data sets and increased pressures on margins imply that human interpreters need to be supplemented by automation and machine learning (ML) driven insights through digital techniques. ML solutions can accelerate interpretation to modeling to reservoir engineering workflows by optimizing first break picking in seismic processing, improving fault detection, stratigraphic interpretation in seismic and reconstructing logs and detect outliers in wellbore. Scalable machine learning requires reliable data products, but operators are fraught with data wrangling challenges across sources without lineage or context. Domain users cannot collaborate well with data scientists further impeding ML models from moving from innovation to production. New wellbore and seismic data can be aggregated across vendors, data stores and contextualized to reliable data products by automated DataOps pipelines. Domain experts can understand these data products and collaboratively work with data scientists on an intuitive ML workbench democratizing the ML craft and providing first principal guard-rails. An MLOps pipeline can manage model versions and continuously deliver qualified ML models into elastic compute-clusters for reliable result prediction on new datasets.

Although blockchain-based healthcare systems can provide security, privacy, and immutability to EMRs, several outstanding security and latency issues are associated with existing schemes. For example, some researchers have used the blockchain as a storage tool which increases delay and adversely affects the blockchain performance since it stores a copy of each transaction. A distributed ledger also requires appropriate space and computational power with increased data size. In addition, existing healthcare-based approaches usually rely on centralized servers connected to clouds, which are vulnerable to denial of service (DoS), distributed DoS (DDoS), and collusion attacks. This paper proposes a novel hybrid-deep learning-based homomorphic encryption (HE) model for the Industrial Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) to cope with such challenges using a consortium blockchain. Integrating HE with the proposed IIoMT system is a vital contribution of this work. The use of HE while outsourcing to the cloud the storage provides a unique facility to perform any statistical and machine learning operation on the encrypted EMR data, hence providing resistance to collusion and phishing attacks. Our proposed model uses a pre-trained hybrid deep learning model in the cloud and deploys the trained model into blockchain-based edge devices in order to classify and train local models using EMRs. This is further conditioned on the private data of each edge and IoT device connected with the consortium blockchain. All local models obtained are aggregated to the cloud to update a global model, which is finally disseminated to the edge nodes. Our proposed approach provides more privacy and security than conventional models and can deliver high efficiency and low end-to-end latency for users. Comparative simulation analysis with state-of-the-art approaches is carried out using benchmark performance metrics, which show that our proposed model provides enhanced security, efficiency, and transparency. © 2013 IEEE.",,"@ARTICLE{Ali20232402,

These readings can be analyzed with machine learning (ML) tools to identify potential failures through anomaly detection, allowing operators to take appropriate corrective actions. Typically, these analyses are conducted on servers located in data centers or the cloud. However, this approach increases system complexity and is susceptible to failure in cases where connectivity is unavailable. Furthermore, this communication restriction limits the approach’s applicability in extreme industrial environments where operating conditions affect communication and access to the system. This paper proposes and evaluates an end-to-end adaptable and configurable anomaly detection system that uses the Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, and Tiny-MLOps methodologies in an extreme industrial environment such as submersible pumps. The system runs on an IoT sensing Kit, based on an ESP32 microcontroller and MicroPython firmware, located near the data source. The processing pipeline on the sensing device collects data, trains an anomaly detection model, and alerts an external gateway in the event of an anomaly. The anomaly detection model uses the isolation forest algorithm, which can be trained on the microcontroller in just 1.2 to 6.4 s and detect an anomaly in less than 16 milliseconds with an ensemble of 50 trees and 80 KB of RAM.

The algorithm was first proposed and used in statistical mechanics by Metropolis et al. (J Chem Phys 21:1087-1092, 1953). Yet, not until Kirkpatrick et al. (Science 220:671-680, 1983) and Cerny (J Optim Theory Appl 45:41–52, 1985) was SA implemented as a heuristic for a notoriously hard combinatorial optimization problem – the traveling salesman problem. Since then, SA has been successfully applied across a broad range of application areas such as finance, machine learning, operations research, etc., where the associated optimization problems can be computationally intractable for large problem instances. In these situations, SA is a serious contender as a convenient, yet effective, optimization tool as it requires no knowledge of the problem structure. Indeed, the key advantage of SA is in its simplicity, which facilitates quick implementation for solving many real-life applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",,"@ARTICLE{Kincaid2023221,

Additionally, the discussion includes the ethical implications of using MLOps techniques in criminal investigations and highlights the need for transparency and fairness in model development and deployment. The detection and prevention of criminal behavior is a critical issue for society. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) techniques to detect and predict criminal behavior. This research paper explores the potential of EEG techniques as a means of detecting crime by analyzing brainwave activity. Specifically, this paper examines the use of alpha and beta waves in identifying deceptive or abnormal behavior (Xie et al 2022).

Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Dentistry department of University. Subjects: Subjects comprised CBCT images of 150 adult patients, including 300 rami. Methods and Materials: In total, 150 CBCT aged between 18 and 35 were selected and divided into three main groups of 50 samples based on their skeletal relationships (classes I, II and III). Patients were subdivided based on their growth pattern (vertical vs. horizontal), resulting in 25 samples per subgroup. Distances between the mandibular lingula and occlusal plane (ML-OP), sigmoid notch (ML-SN), external oblique ridge (ML-EOR), internal oblique ridge (ML-IOR), posterior border of the ramus (ML-PBR), inferior border of the ramus (ML-IBR), and horizontal and vertical distances to the mandibular foramen (ML-hMF and ML-vMF). One-way ANOVA variance analysis was employed to compare different angle classifications, and Bonferroni analysis was used for multiple comparisons. The Student's t-test was also used to compare growth patterns within each main group and genders within the subgroup. Results: The study revealed statistically significant differences in the position of the mandibular lingula between different angle classifications, growth patterns, and genders. Class II samples showed a more anterior position of the ML, whereas Class III samples displayed a more posterior position of the ML. Patients with horizontal growth patterns and Angle Class III had a more posteriorly positioned ML. Gender differences were observed, particularly in Class I and Class III classifications, suggesting that gender may influence the variability of ML position in these specific classifications.

It includes monitoring ML models for changes like model performance degradation, resultant data drift, and concept drift, and ensuring that the developed model is maintaining an optimum level of performance. ML teams can use model performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall to monitor the real time or live performance of production models. However, these metrics need ‘ground truth’ or labels for these real-time predictions. Although labels are always available in a training data set, they might not always be available in production for a given use case. In the absence of inputs or to complement the visibility of the performance metrics, monitoring live changes in production features and prediction distributions can be used as an indicator and troubleshooting tool for issues in performance. Proper model monitoring can help improve model performance, increase transparency, and ensure that models are deployed ethically and responsibly.

Accordingly, Data Science (DS), which encompasses the methods to extract knowledge from data, has increased in popularity. Nevertheless, enterprises often fail to reap the benefits from data as they suffer from high failure rates in the conducted DS projects. Literature suggests that the main reason for the lack of success is shortcomings in the current pool of DS project management methodologies. Hence, new procedures for DS are required. Consequently, in this paper, the outline for a model for DS project standardization and automation is discussed. Following a summary of DS project challenges and success factors, the concept, which will incorporate MLOps and cloud technologies, and its individual components to address these issues are described on a high level. Therefore, the foundation for further research endeavors in this area is presented. Copyright © 2023 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.",,"@CONFERENCE{Haertel2023294,

The study begins by conducting an SLR to identify the challenges mentioned in the literature. We then explain the results of conducting semi-structured interviews with 12 ML practitioners working across many industries, perform qualitative content analysis using grounded theory, and discuss findings. Findings are organised along four distinct dimensions: Organisational, Technical, Operational and Business challenges, which are explained in eleven different themes. Our findings show that MLOps has some challenges that overlap with DevOps as well as some specific only to MLOps, like the complexity of data and model.

The possibility of using modern MLOps solutions to improve the development processes of machine learning information systems has been studied. The results of the operation of the model in the Kubeflow arsenal have been checked using such improvement factors as speed of development, implementation of changes, reduction of time to search for problems, recovery after global interruptions, and decrease of the number of errors in the model. For practical analysis, a publicly available model was deployed in a Kubeflow cluster using the Seldon Core Serving application manifest. The conducted research showed that Kubeflow consists of a set of various open-source components that have a high level of integration with each other through the Kubernetes platform.

In this quest, location-based advertising on mobile devices has emerged as an important marketing tool for targeting potential customers. The design of such advertising campaigns is complex, and their effectiveness depends on the ability to collect and examine data that aids in targeting the right customers at the right time and place. We develop a campaign design framework that explicitly accounts for the costs of acquiring and utilizing targeting data and the heterogeneous effects of such data in affecting the performance outcomes of mobile advertising campaigns. We illustrate the application of our campaign design framework through a real-world case study of a mobile advertising campaign undertaken by a large global retail firm. Our findings suggest that the optimal set of attributes to use for effectively targeting the potential customers of a brick-and-mortar retail store varies with the distance between the customers' current locations and that of the store. As a result, mobile campaign design approaches that utilize all or a naive subset of data attributes for targeted advertising yield lower levels of return on investments, relative to our proposed approach. Based on our results, we discuss implications for the design and deployment of mobile advertising campaigns and for further research on targeted advertising. © 2023 Production and Operations Management Society.",,"@ARTICLE{Keshanian20232438,

The increasing interest in artificial intelligence has highlighted the difficulty of designing an appropriate business case and monitoring the real business value generated by such services due to the complexity of machine learning methods and techniques. Managers have proven frameworks for constructing key performance indicators, machine learning engineers have developed advanced methods and techniques for evaluating and monitoring Machine Learning (ML) models, and scientists have tested methods for empirically evaluating the added value of innovations. By leveraging the strengths of each discipline, the proposed framework enables managers, machine learning engineers, and scientists to efficiently work together and optimize the value of intelligent services during their lifecycle. We propose processes and procedures for creating, capturing, organizing, storing, sharing, and using knowledge in advanced machine learning projects. He also presents key machine learning methods and techniques for monitoring and optimizing the value of intelligent services over their lifecycle, including the adaptation of MLOps methodology for continuous monitoring, reinforcement learning for continuous improvement, and CausalML methods for identifying the root-causes of changes in the business value. These methods and techniques support knowledge management activities and help formulate a competency framework for team members and project stakeholders. We point out the potential of academic researchers and external advisors as catalyzers in such projects based on real-life implementation. He also proposes a method for designing the ML knowledge flywheel to ensure continuous knowledge transfer and improvement in the business-engineer-academy triangle. The approach is illustrated by a case study of the implementation of a marketing communication optimization system in a large, multinational financial company for more than 20 thousand customers in two European countries. Managers and machine learning engineers can implement the proposed knowledge management framework in various organizations for the efficient design, monitoring, and optimization of the business value of intelligent services. © 2023 Academic Conferences Limited.

Radiology is a medical discipline that utilizes medical imaging to guide treatment. Radiologists prepare reports interpreting details and findings analysed from medical images. Radiology free-text reports are a rich source of textual information that can be exploited to enhance the efficacy of medical prognosis, treatment and research. Radiology reports exist in an unstructured format as are not suitable by themselves for mathematical computation or machine learning operations. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) strategies are employed to convert unstructured natural language text into a structured format that can be fed into machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) models for information extraction. We propose a DL-based medical text modelling framework incorporating a knowledge base to predict pulmonary diseases from unstructured radiology free-text reports.

These solvers are the foremost method for solving discrete optimization problems and have a vast array of applications in machine learning, operations research, and many other fields. Choosing cutting planes effectively is a major research topic in the theory and practice of integer programming. We conduct a novel structural analysis of branch-and-cut that pins down how every step of the algorithm is affected by changes in the parameters defining the cutting planes added to an integer program. Our main application of this analysis is to derive sample complexity guarantees for using machine learning to determine which cutting planes to apply during branch-and-cut. These guarantees apply to infinite families of cutting planes, such as the family of Gomory mixed integer cuts, which are responsible for the main breakthrough speedups of integer programming solvers. We exploit geometric and combinatorial structure of branch-and-cut in our analysis, which provides a key missing piece for the recent generalization theory of branch-and-cut. © 2022 Neural information processing systems foundation.

Through a model-to-data approach, Federated Machine Learning yields huge potential from privacy by design to heavily reducing communication costs and offline usage. However, the implementation and management of Federated Machine Learning projects can be challenging, as it involves coordinating multiple parties across different stages of the project life cycle. We observed that Federated Machine Learning is missing clarity over the individual involved roles including their activities, interactions, dependencies, and responsibilities which are needed to establish governance and help practitioners operationalize Federated Machine Learning projects. We argue that a process model, which is closely aligned with established MLOps principles can provide this clarification. In this position paper, we make a case for the necessity of a role model to structure distinct roles, an activity model to understand the involvement and operations of each role, and an artifact model to demonstrate how artifacts are used and structured. Additionally, we argue, that a process model is needed to capture the dependencies and interactions between the roles, activities, and artifacts across the different stages of the life cycle. Furthermore, we describe our research approach and the current status of our ongoing research toward this goal. We believe that our proposed process model will provide a foundation for the governance of Federated Machine Learning projects, and enable practitioners to leverage the benefits of decentralized data computation.

Here, each vertex in a MS-DF graph denotes a single operation(e.g. Conv2D, MatMul) which consists of typical machine learning computing processes. And each edge connecting two operations denotes the dependency of these two operations, the term ""dependency"" means the output of an operation is the input of the other operation linked by an edge. Currently, cluster scheduling for MS-DF is one of the main works that can guarantee the execution efficiency of machine learning systems, and it is one of the hot research topics in machine learning system area. Diving into the principle of cluster scheduling for MS-DF, machine learning systems are key factors that affect the performance of cluster scheduling, since they work as a middle layer to decouple the computing of machine learning and cluster resource(e.g. CPU, GPU and FPGA) allocations. By this way, cluster resources are no longer exclusively and statically bound to one computation of machine learning. Instead, machine learning systems may manage different kinds of resources dynamically, but at the cost of increased complexity of cluster scheduling for MS-DF. Under this circumstance, machine learning operations can heavily affect the dynamic management of cluster resources, thus new challenges arise. We demonstrate that these challenges are caused by the following three aspects: (1) the accuracy of profiling operations' heterogeneous resource requirements. (2) the adaptability of operation scheduling decisions. (3) the variability of operation scheduling adjustments. In addition to above challenges, we analyze and summarize the latest researches of cluster scheduling for MS-DF in recent years, and how these researches cope with challenges. (1) We introduce the mechanisms of both machine learning operation perception and cooperation that can be used to profile operations' heterogeneous resource requirement, such mechanisms can estimate the actual operation resource usage through many metrics(e.g. input dataset sizes, operation dependencies), thus we can improve the accuracy of profiling especially when operations have many combinations. (2) We introduce different scheduling decisions with three main factors including operation scheduling constraints, models and algorithms. Such decisions should be able to be deliberately set with different factors, thus we can adaptively provide operations with preferred resources when their states frequently change. (3) We introduce several scheduling adjustment strategies to further improve the performance of cluster scheduling. These strategies include operation migration, scaling, and suspending/resuming. One strategy or hybrid strategies can be useful under certain operation synchronization patterns(e.g. PS, AllReduce). Thus, we can use different strategies for different patterns. At last, we conclude the latest researches with the new trend of machine learning systems and the development of heterogeneous resources. We give our prospective view of the key technologies of cluster scheduling for MS-DF: (1) the multi-level analysis and collaborative characterization of operations' heterogeneous resource requirements. (2) the flexible definition and discovery of operations' complex scheduling constraints. (3) learning-driven optimization of operation scheduling at a low cost. They may improve cluster scheduling for MS-DF in a more efficient and intelligent way. © 2022, Science Press. All right reserved.",,"@ARTICLE{Xu2022973,

However, the data inputs to these calculations depend on how the raw data from maintenance repair records have been processed. Furthermore, processes to extract and clean raw maintenance data are often ad hoc and performed differently by each engineer. As a result, calculations for asset reliability measures and identification of historical events and failure modes are difficult to replicate. Currently, the process is manual, time-consuming and not scalable. As a solution we present RelOps, a process to achieve standardised, scalable, and efficient end-to-end data handling and processing for organisation-wide reliability analysis. The process is illustrated with a case study showing current practice in MTBF estimation and the opportunities for technical language processing (TLP) to infer MTBF from maintenance work orders raised against a slurry pump.RelOps draws on DevOps and MLOps practices widely used in the software engineering and machine learning communities.

The work addresses several challenges: prioritizing data to reduce movement, tracking lineage to optimize complex ML pipelines, and enabling reproducibility and portability of data selection and ML model development. Off-the-shelf AI metadata management frameworks (such as MLflow or Weights & Biases) focus on fine-grain stage-level metadata, and only track parts of the pipeline, and lineage. Our proposed software layer sits between ML workflows and pipelines and storage/data access. The first implementation of the Data Foundation is the Common Metadata Framework (CMF), which captures metadata and tracks them automatically alongside references to data artifacts and application code. Its git-like nature allows parallel model development by different teams and is well suited for federated environments. It includes intelligence to optimize pipelines and storage, can learn the access patterns from pipeline execution to inform optimizations such as prestaging and caching. It also learns from model inference metrics to build iteratively more robust models. Through a data shaping use case for I/O optimization and an active learning use case to reduce labelling (on DeepCam AI model training on climate data running on NERSC Cori), we show the versatility of the data foundation layer, the potential benefits (4x reduction in training time and 2x reduction in labelling effort), and its central role in complex ML pipelines. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"@ARTICLE{Justine202220,

While several sensing and evaluation methods related to cracking have been proposed, recent demands for real-time assessment have created the need to connect data acquisition with rapid extraction of information that can be leveraged in both diagnostics and prognostics. This investigation presents a novel approach to leveraging nondestructive evaluation (NDE) datasets in an internet of things (IoT) framework, which is shown to be capable of providing nearly real-time diagnostics for cracking, while creating also the framework to apply prognostics methods. To demonstrate this approach, compacttension specimens of an aluminum alloy were used in laboratory experiments in accordance with ASTM standards. Acoustic emission NDE datasets were acquired and used to produce information that was processed using an in-house-built IoT system capable of edge and cloud computing. The main innovation of this approach is that a combination of IoT hardware and software proves advantageous in implementing a data structure that can then be used in machine learning operations that are suitable for detecting crack initiation.  © 2022 by ASTM International, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, PO Box C700, West Conshohocken, PA 19428-2959.",,"@CONFERENCE{Malik2022234,

The purpose of this research is to analyze the quality effect of a continuously learning neural network algorithm for document classification by taking user feedback into account. The hypothesis implies that user feedback through active learning increases the precision and thus makes the process of document classification more efficient. For this purpose, based on a utility analysis, the available technologies are identified, and necessary ones are selected for designing a software concept. TensorFlow as a deep learning framework, Tesseract as an OCR engine, and Apache Airflow for the life cycle management and for orchestrating the elements for the continuous training pipeline are used. This implementation of a machine learning as a service prototype allows for exploration into the synergistic effect between the use of active learning, in the form of user feedback, and the quality of document classification achieved by deep learning. In an experiment, the implemented service is used to analyze the models behavior based on three different states. This includes synthetic data and active learning in the form of user feedback through data from data augmentation and simulated realistic data. The result shows that active learning enhanced models indicate a higher accuracy than artificially generated models. The evaluation experiment confirms the hypothesis that user feedback with continuously learning models perform better in terms of generalizing within the document classification. In conclusion, the paper demonstrates the technical requirements for implementing a machine learning as a service and affirms that the use of active learning can be integrated into existing industrial systems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"@ARTICLE{Walter-Tscharf2022229,

A typical TC failure is the False Occupancy (FO), i.e., a TC results occupied for a certain period of time when there is no train on it. FO can be resolved by manually driving a train on the faulty TC with a waste of time and resources. After a FO, operators, based on their experience, need to decide if there is an actual need for maintenance or if the problem is due to other temporary causes. In this paper, we propose a Simple Informed Machine Learning (ML) based model able to automatically prescribe maintenance after a FO fully leveraging on the operator experience. However, ML models in modern industrial MLOps pipelines demand continuous data collection, model re-training, testing, and monitoring, creating a large technical debt. In fact, one of the main requirements of these pipelines is to not be regressive, i.e., not simply improve average performance but not introduce mistakes previously not present (negative flips). In this work we face this problem by empowering the proposed ML with Non Regressive properties.

Yet, these challenges, outside of the algorithm, are less discussed in literature. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to practically illustrate several best practices, and challenges, discovered while building an ML system to detect tool wear in metal CNC machining. Namely, one should focus on the data infrastructure first; begin modeling with simple models; be cognizant of data leakage; use open-source software; and leverage advances in computational power. The ML system developed in this work is built upon classical ML algorithms and is applied to a real-world manufacturing CNC dataset. The best-performing random forest model on the CNC dataset achieves a true positive rate (sensitivity) of 90.3% and a true negative rate (specificity) of 98.3%. The results are suitable for deployment in a production environment and demonstrate the practicality of the classical ML algorithms and techniques used.

Depending on the type of AI task (classification, object detection, segmentation, instance segmentation...) multiple metrics are evaluated. Both labeled (specificity, sensitivity...), unlabeled (outlier score, confidence score...) and user-defined metrics can be included. Optionally, the confidence interval (CI) is calculated. In a last step, the metric values and CI are used to rank the slices to quickly find the slices of interest. Custom ranking methods can be added, keeping the full process from slice generation up to and including visualization modular and customizable. We illustrate the toolbox with a dermatology classification and object detection use-case. First a single model is evaluated down to crosses of three slices where slices of interest are detected on degree three which would be difficult to find if not automated. Additionally, the usage of unlabeled metrics such as outlier score is illustrated to automatically find slices of interest. © 2023 SPIE.",,"@CONFERENCE{Vandewiele2023,

These insurers often act on the same data for their own internal modeling and analytics needs. The problem is this data is messy and needs significant preparation in order to extract meaningful insights. Traditionally, this has required intensive manual labor from actuaries. However, a host of modern AI techniques and ML system architectures introduced in the past decade can be applied to the problem of insurance data preparation. In this paper, we explore a novel application of AI/ML on policy listings data that poses its own unique challenges, by outlining the holistic AI-based platform we developed, ECLIPSE (Elegant Cleaning and Labeling of Insurance Policies while Standardizing Entities).

(57213699511)",Computer Systems Science and Engineering,Article,"CC's (Cloud Computing) networks are distributed and dynamic as signals appear/disappear or lose significance. MLTs (Machine learning Techniques) train datasets which sometime are inadequate in terms of sample for inferring information. A dynamic strategy, DevMLOps (Development Machine Learning Operations) used in automatic selections and tunings of MLTs result in significant performance differences. But, the scheme has many disadvantages including continuity in training, more samples and training time in feature selections and increased classification execution times. RFEs (Recursive Feature Eliminations) are computationally very expensive in its operations as it traverses through each feature without considering correlations between them. This problem can be overcome by the use of Wrappers as they select better features by accounting for test and train datasets. The aim of this paper is to use DevQLMLOps for automated tuning and selections based on orchestrations and messaging between containers.

However, while MLOps is often discussed in the context of pure software systems, Industry 4.0 systems received much less attention. So far, there is no specialized research for Industry 4.0 in this regard. In this position paper, we discuss whether MLOps in Industry 4.0 leads to significantly different challenges compared to typical Internet systems. We identify both context-independent MLOps challenges (general challenges) as well as challenges particular to Industry 4.0 (specific challenges) and conclude that MLOps works very similarly in Industry 4.0 systems to pure software systems.

OPS-2071 exhibited potent antibacterial activity against 54 clinically isolated C. difficile strains with a MIC of 0.125mg/ml (MIC50) and 0.5mg/ml (MIC90), making it more active than vancomycin on a concentration basis (MIC50, 2mg/ml; MIC90, 4mg/ml) and comparable to fidaxomicin (MIC50, 0.063mg/ml; MIC90, 8μg/ml). OPS-2071 showed equally potent antibacterial activity against both hypervirulent and nonhypervirulent strains, while a significant difference in susceptibility to fidaxomicin was observed. Spontaneous resistance to OPS-2071 and vancomycin was not observed; however, resistance to fidaxomicin was observed at 4× MIC.

Nevertheless, one of the drawbacks of the practice of medical diagnosis is the lack of explanation on the proposed solution, which is also known as a black box, without knowing the internal decision process between the input and output. It will lead to untrustworthiness and difficult to understand by the medical expert. They are questioning how the complexity of machine learning methods decide on the output without clear and understandable explanations. Moreover, in machine learning field the characteristic of a black box model may lead to biased data analysis and incorrect output decisions. There is work that uses visual analytics techniques to interpret the machine learning output to ease the understanding of medical experts. However, the functionality of existed and combined visual analytics techniques is not sufficient to visualized and interpreted the output of machine learning operation. Other visual analytic techniques faced the same problem, unreliability to produce strong reason on the output when working with complex machine learning models. This paper analyzed several visual analytics approaches instantiated in machine learning algorithm for medical record analytics. The motivation of this paper is to allow medical experts to understand the interpretation of a black box machine learning model in predicting medical outcome. This paper studied on the effectiveness of visual analytics techniques to identify the appropriate technique to be instantiated to the machine learning algorithm to further elaborate the results obtained by demonstrating transparency, interpretability and explainability of the machine learning algorithm.

These models have the potential to improve care, but are challenging to internally validate, implement, and maintain over the long term. Principles of ML operations (MLOps) may inform development of infrastructure to support the entire ML lifecycle, from feature selection to long-term model deployment and retraining. Objectives This study aimed to present the conceptual prototypes for a novel predictive model management system and to evaluate the acceptability of the system among three groups of end users. Methods Based on principles of user-centered software design, human-computer interaction, and ethical design, we created graphical prototypes of a web-based MLOps interface to support the construction, deployment, and maintenance of models using EHR data. To assess the acceptability of the interface, we conducted semistructured user interviews with three groups of users (health informaticians, clinical and data stakeholders, chief information officers) and evaluated preliminary usability using the System Usability Scale (SUS). We subsequently revised prototypes based on user input and developed user case studies. Results Our prototypes include design frameworks for feature selection, model training, deployment, long-term maintenance, visualization over time, and cross-functional collaboration. Users were able to complete 71% of prompted tasks without assistance. The average SUS score of the initial prototype was 75.8 out of 100, translating to a percentile range of 70 to 79, a letter grade of B, and an adjective rating of good. We reviewed persona-based case studies that illustrate functionalities of this novel prototype.

Presently, the economy is recovering slightly, and students are entering the working life already during their studies. These reasons have fortified demands for flexibility to keep the target graduation time the same as before, even shorten it. Required flexibility is created by increasing distance learning and MOOCs, which challenges students’ self-regulation skills. Teaching methods and systems need to evolve to support students’ progress. At the curriculum design level, such learning analytics tools have already been taken into use. This position paper outlines a next-generation, course-scope analytics tool that utilises data from both the learning management system and Gitlab, which works here as a channel of student submissions. Gitlab provides GitOps, and GitOps will be enhanced with machine learning, thereby transforming as MLOps. MLOps that performs learning analytics, is called here LAOps. For analysis, data is copied to the cloud, and for that, it must be properly protected, after which models are trained and analyses performed. The results are provided to both teachers and students and utilised for personalisation and differentiation of exercises based on students’ skill level.

However, full-scale deep neural networks are often too resource-intensive in terms of energy and storage. As a result, the bulk part of the machine learning operation is therefore often carried out on an edge server, where the data is compressed and transmitted. However, compressing data (such as images) leads to transmitting information irrelevant to the supervised task. Another popular approach is to split the deep network between the device and the server while compressing intermediate features. To date, however, such split computing strategies have barely outperformed the aforementioned naive data compression baselines due to their inefficient approaches to feature compression. This paper adopts ideas from knowledge distillation and neural image compression to compress intermediate feature representations more efficiently. Our supervised compression approach uses a teacher model and a student model with a stochastic bottleneck and learnable prior for entropy coding (Entropic Student). We compare our approach to various neural image and feature compression baselines in three vision tasks and found that it achieves better supervised rate-distortion performance while maintaining smaller end-to-end latency. We furthermore show that the learned feature representations can be tuned to serve multiple downstream tasks.  © 2022 IEEE.",,"@CONFERENCE{Matsubara2022923,

In addition to the conventional instrument-based approaches for quantifying organic pollutants, a monitoring method using transgenic plants has also been proposed. Plants carrying a recombinant receptor gene combined with a reporter gene represent a system for the easy detection of ligands that specifically bind to the receptor molecule. Here, the EDC detection sensitivity of transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the medaka (Oryzias latipes) estrogen receptor (mER) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) genes, was assessed. Four transgenic Arabidopsis lines, obtained by transformation with expression plasmids constructed using combinations of two types of the ligand-binding domains of mER, the DNA-binding domain of LexA and the transactivation domain of VP16 in the chimeric receptors, showed significant induction of GFP when germinated on a medium contaminated with 1 ng/mL 4-t-octylphenol (OP). The most sensitive XmEV19-2 plants detected 0.1 ng/mL OP and 1 pg/mL 17β-estradiol. GFP expression was suppressed by the insecticides imidacloprid and fipronil, whereas perfluorooctanesulfonic acid induced it at 0.1 ng/mL. Experiments with river water-based medium showed that XmEV19-2 can be used for monitoring polluted waters, detecting OP at concentrations as low as 5 ng/mL. Notably, XmEV19-2 showed a significant decrease in root length when grown on 0.1 ng/mL OP. mER transgenic plants can be a promising tool for simple monitoring of EDCs, without the need for extraction and concentration steps in sample preparation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,"@ARTICLE{Stoykova2022,

Methods From January 2017 to December 2020, a total of 90 cases of HDCP pregnant women admitted to the Shanghai First Maternal and Infant Hospital, Tongji University were included into observation group, and according to whether they were concurrent with AKI, they were further divided into AKI subgroup (n=35) and non-AKI subgroup (n = 55). Meanwhile another 90 healthy pregnant women underwent prenatal examination in the same hospital during the same period were selected into control group. Multivariate unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the influencing factors of AKI in HDCP pregnant women. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves of different indexes to predict HDCP pregnant women complicated with AKI were drawn, and area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. According to the principle of maximum Youden index, the best critical value of different indexes for predicting HDCP complicated with AKI were determined. The procedure followed in this study met the standards formulated by the Ethics Review Committee of shanghai First Maternal and Infant Hospital, Tongji University and has been approved by it (Approval No. KS2204). Informed consent was obtained from each participate. Results CD There were no significant differences between observation group and control group in age, gestational age and gravidity (P>0. 05). (2) The levels of SUA and NLRP3 inflammasome in observation group were significantly higher than those in control group, and the levels of SUA and NLRP3 inflammasome in AKI subgroup were significantly higher than those in non-AKI subgroup, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0. 05). © Univariate analysis of influencing factors of concurrent with AKI in HDCP pregnant women showed that placental abruption, volumes of postpartum hemorrhage and blood pressure might be the influencing factors of concurrent with AKI in HDCP pregnant women (X2 = 5. 442, 9.091, 6.461; P = 0.019, 0.011, 0.039). (4) Multivariate unconditional logistic regression analysis showed that SUA>361. 8 jumol/L (QR = 1.085, 95%C7: 1.062-1.320, P< 0.001) and NLRP3 inflammasome > 5. 6 (OP = 2.732, 95% CI: 1.074-3.665, P = 0. 003), postpartum hemorrhage were 1 000-1 500 mL and >1 500 mL (OP=l. 971, 1. 863, 95%CI: 1. 011-4.540, 1.016-4.950, P = 0.020, 0.019), and blood pressure were > 160-180 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0. 133 kPa) and >180 mmHg (OP=2. 000, 1. 903; 95%CI: 0. 255-1. 784, 0. 245-1. 795; P=0. 001, 0. 001) were independent risk factors caused concurrent of AKI in HDCP pregnant women. (5) The AUC of SUA combined with NLRP3 inflammasome in predicting AKI in HDCP pregnant women was 0. 966 (95%C7: 0. 962-0. 970, P<0. 05). According to the principle of maximum Youden index, the best critical value of combining SUA and NLRP3 inflammasome in predicting AKI in HDCP pregnant women were 371.2 jumol/L, 5.8, and its sensitivity was 97.5% and specificity was 96.8%. Conclusions The combined assessment of SUA and NLRP3 inflammasome has a good predictive performance for the concurrent of AKI in patients with HDCP, and may provide references for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of early AKI during pregnancy. © Chinese Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Pediatrics.All rights reserved",,"@ARTICLE{Wang2021663,

Objective To see if intraoperative bleeding was associated with a less favorable outcome, and to identify patient-specific risk factors for intraoperative bleeding. Setting Nationwide, Sweden. Methods Patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery between January 8, 2007, and September 15, 2015, were included in the study. The volume of intraoperative blood loss was compared with data from follow-up at day 30 and 1 and 2 years after surgery. Patient-specific factors were analyzed as potential risk factors for intraoperative bleeding. Results The study included 43,157 patients. Intraoperative bleeding was associated with an increased risk for postoperative complication (100–499 mL, odds ratio [OR] 2.97, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 2.53–3.50;>500 mL OR 3.34, 95%CI 2.05–5.44), lower weight loss (<100 mL, 82.4±24.19% excess body mass index-loss [%EBMIL]; 100–499 mL, 76.9±24.24 %EBMIL, P<.0001;>500 mL 76.9±23.89 %EBMIL, P =.063) and lower reported quality-of-life 2 years after surgery (<100 mL, Obesity-related Problem scale (OP) 21.1±24.46; 100–499 mL, OP 25.0±26.62, P =.008;>500 mL, OP 25.2±24.46, P =.272). Diabetes (OR 1.30, 95%CI 1.08–1.58), age (OR 1.02, 95%CI 1.02–1.03), and body mass index (OR 1.03, 95%CI 1.02–1.05) were patient-specific risk factors for intraoperative bleeding≥100 mL, whereas intentional preoperative weight loss was associated with a lower risk (OR.50, 95%CI.43–.57).

In this study, potassium ferrate derived from drinking water treatment sludge (DWTS) was utilized in the ultrasound assisted oxidative desulfurization of dibenzothiophene (DBT) and benzothiophene (BT). Wet oxidation method was applied in the synthesis of potassium ferrate from DWTS. Elemental analysis of DWTS revealed that the main constituents are 28.85% Fe, 23.70% O and 19.74% Mn, which implies that the sludge as a potential source of iron for ferrate(VI) production. The effect of operating parameters such as organic to aqueous phase ratio (OP), ferrate concentration, phase transfer agent amount (TOAB), and sonication time on the sulphur conversion has been investigated. Optimization studies were performed via response surface methodology using box-behnken design. Optimal condition for DBT conversion was attained at 20 mL OP, 200-ppm ferrate(VI), 200 mg TOAB and 20 min, which provided a 43.91% conversion. On the other hand, a 96.03% BT conversion was achieved at 10 mL OP, 200-ppm ferrate(VI), 100-mg PTA and 20 min. Based from the analysis of variance, sonication time is the only significant factor that could affect % sulfur conversion for BT (F value = 12.47; p value < 0.0087) and DBT (F value = 8.08; p value < 0.0130). © 15th International Symposium on East Asian Resources Recycling Technology, EARTH 2019.

A sequential extraction procedure was used to analyze the phosphorus (P) forms in the rhizosphere/non-rhizosphere soil with a variety of plant growth conditions (April, July, October). The soil bacteria community structure and the diversity was measured using the high-throughput of 16S rRNA amplicons. Furthermore, the complete crystallographic analysis (CCA) method was used to analyze the relationship between phosphate solubilizing microorganisms and P transformation in the soil samples. The results showed that the rank order of inorganic P (IP) fractions in the soil was generally as follows: Ca-bound P (Ca-P) >Occluded P (Oc-P) >Fe-bound P (Fe-P) >Exchangeable P (Ex-P) >Al-bound P (Al-P). The IP content was most affected by the growth of Phragmites communis. The minimum content of IP appeared in the vigorous growth period and the total IP content in the rhizosphere soil was generally lower than in the non-rhizosphere soil. The rank order of organic P (OP) fractions were highly resistant OP (HR-OP) >moderately resistant OP (MR-OP) > moderately labile OP (ML-OP) > labile OP (L-OP), and all the components of OP first decreased and then increased with the growth of plant. The major phylogenic groups in rhizosphere/non-rhizosphere soil of Phragmites communis, included Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Actinobacteria among which, Proteobacteria was the majority group in the community composition. Furthermore, the rhizosphere/non-rhizosphere microbial community structure was significantly affected by seasonal changes and existing differences between the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils. In addition, the main functional groups of the modal transformation of P bacteria genera were Bacillus, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, Acinetobacter, which can make use of most OP and IP, playing an important role in the transformation of P in wetland soils. © 2017, Science Press.

The cells were cultured with hCG (0.1, 1, 10, 100 IU/ml), OP (10, 25, 50, 100 μM), RU486 (100 μM), P4 (1, 10, 25, 50 μM) or some combination of the four for 24 h. Cell viability was significantly increased by hCG (100 IU/ml) and significantly decreased by OP (100 μM) compared with the control. Cells treated with hCG and OP together were significantly less viable than the control and OP-treated cells. The combined treatment also significantly increased CASP3 activity and cleaved CASP3 protein expression. Furthermore, P4 addition reversed the reduction in cell viability caused by the combination of hCG and OP treatment. The overall findings suggest that hCG cooperates with P4 to increase survival of hLGCs and to induce apoptosis when P4 action supported by hCG is attenuated in the human CL. © 2015 by the Society for Reproduction and Development.",,"@ARTICLE{Hirata201567,

The evaluations are performed with HEVC reference encoder (HM) whose M10P and MP are benchmarked with different resolutions, frame rates, and bit depths. The reported RD results are based on bit rate differences for equal PSNR whereas complexities have been profiled with Intel VTune on Intel Core 2 processor. With our 10-bit 4K 120 fps test set, the average bit rate decrements of M10P over MP are 5.8%, 11.6%, and 12.3% in the all-intra (AI), random access (RA), and low-delay B (LB) configurations, respectively. Decreasing the bit depth of this test set to 8 lowers the RD gain of Ml OP only slightly to 5.4% (AI), 11.4% (RA), and 12.1% (LB). The similar trend continues in all our tests even though the RD gain of M10P is decreased over MP with lower resolutions and frame rates. M10P introduces no computational overhead in HM, but it is anticipated to increase complexity and double the memory usage in practical encoders.

This paper presents the results of a pragmatic, prospective, observational study to evaluate outcomes of non-operative (NOP) versus operative (OP) management of blunt abdominal solid organ trauma in hemodynamically stable adults admitted to Tanta University Emergency Hospital (TUH) in Egypt. Methods: A prospective observational study enrolled adult blunt abdominal trauma patients with solid organ injury at TUH over a 3-year period (June 2014–June 2017). Inclusion criteria were age ≥18 yr, mean arterial pressure >65 mm Hg, heart rate <110 bpm, hematocrit ≥7 mg/dl, and abdominal organ injury diagnosed by ultrasound or computed tomography (CT). Excluded patients were those with pelvis and femur fractures; patients with penetrating abdominal trauma; predominate burn injuries, children and pregnant women. All patients were assigned to non-operative or operative management based on clinician preference. Outcomes of interest were 30-day mortality, blood transfusion volume, and length of stay. Descriptive statistics and χ2 were used to compare outcomes. Results: During the study period, 4254 trauma patients presented to TUH. Of these, 790 had blunt abdominal trauma and 111 (14.1%) met inclusion criteria. Injury severity scores for each group were comparable (24 ± 10 – NOP vs. 28 ± 11 – OP, p = 0.126). NOP received less transfused blood (213.41 ± 360.3 ml [NOP] vs.1155.17 ± 380.4 ml [OP] (p < 0.0001)) but had a longer length of stay (8.29 ± 2.8 [NOP] vs. 6.45 ± 1.97 days [OP] (p = 0.012)). There was no difference in mortality between groups (p = 0.091). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that non-operative management in Egypt of blunt abdominal trauma was safe and resulted in fewer procedures, fewer units of blood transfused, and no increase in mortality. Longer length of stay for non-operative patients might reflect treating physician caution in their management. © 2020 African Federation for Emergency Medicine",,"@ARTICLE{Ibrahim2020123,

Intelligent parking slot allotter can grant permission to access the parking area with less human inference. This system can capture image of the vehicle, identify the type of vehicle and allot best fit and optimal parking slot based on its size. It extracts the vehicle’s license plate number, entry time, exit time and calculate total time of the vehicle present with in the parking space. Here, sensors are utilized to identify the presence of the vehicle during entry and exit. Two cameras are utilized to extract features. One camera is used to identify the region of interest, vehicle license plate and identify the characters from the license plate. Tesseract engine and optical character recognition (OCR) functions are used to detect characters from the image. Another camera is utilized to extract features like dimensions of the vehicle using machine learning operations such as convolutional neural network (CNN). Based on the size of the vehicle, best fit parking slot is allotted which gives optimal usage of parking area. These days the quantity of vehicles is expanding exceptionally, so that, searching for an empty parking slot turns out to be increasingly troublesome. By installing the intelligent parking slot allotter, in places like, shopping malls, train stations, and airports the need for searching of parking slot significantly reduces. A past study has demonstrated that traffic because of vehicle’s parking slot searching in downtowns of significant urban communities can represent half of the absolute traffic.

The first objective is to learn semantic and instance-boundary detectors without manual labeling. An adversarial training framework in conjunction with physics-based simulation is used to achieve detectors that behave similarly in synthetic and real data. Given the stochastic output of such detectors, candidates for object poses are sampled. The second objective is to automatically learn a single score for each pose candidate that represents its quality in terms of explaining the entire scene via a gradient boosted tree. The proposed method uses features derived from surface and boundary alignment between the observed scene and the object model placed at hypothesized poses. Scene-level, multi-instance pose estimation is then achieved by an integer linear programming process that selects hypotheses that maximize the sum of the learned individual scores, while respecting constraints, such as avoiding collisions. To evaluate this method, a dataset of densely packed objects with challenging setups for state-of-the-art approaches is collected. Experiments on this dataset and a public one show that the method significantly outperforms alternatives in terms of 6D pose accuracy while trained only with synthetic datasets. © 2019 CoRL.

It is obvious that machine learning technologies will be developing fast and becoming part of the human information space both in our everyday life and in professional activities. However, building of machine learning systems requires great labour contribution of specialists in the sphere of artificial intelligence and the subject area where this technology is to be applied. The article considers technologies and potential application of machine learning at mining companies. The article describes basic methods of machine learning: unsupervised learning, action learning, semi-supervised machine learning. The criteria are singled out to assess machine learning: operation speed; assessment time; implemented model accuracy; ease of integration; flexible deployment within the subject area; ease of practical application; result visualization. The article describes practical application of machine learning technologies and considers the dispatch system at a mining enterprise (as exemplified by the dispatch system of the mining and transportation complex ""Quarry"" used to increase efficiency of operating management of enterprise performance; to increase reliability and agility of mining and transportation complex performance records and monitoring. There is also a list of equipment performance data that can be stored in the database and used as a basis for processing by machine learning algorithms and obtaining new knowledge.

We propose the use of smartphones as participatory sensors via their cameras to detect the moving and stationary objects (e.g., cars and lane markers) and understand the resulting driving and traffic violation of each object. We propose novel framework which uses a fast in-mobile traffic violation detector for rapid detection of traffic rule violation. After that, the smartphone transmits the data to the cloud where more powerful computer vision and machine learning operations are used to detect the traffic violation with a higher accuracy. We show that the proposed framework detection is very accurate by combining a) a Haarlike feature cascade detector at the in-mobile level, and b) a deep learning-based classifier, and support-vector machine-based classifiers in the cloud. The accuracy of the deep convolutional network is about 92% for true positive and 95% for true negative. The proposed framework demonstrates a potential for mobilebased traffic violation detection by especially by combining the information of accurate relative position and relative speed. Finally, we propose a real-time scheduling scheme in order to optimize the use of battery and real-time bandwidth of the users given partially known navigation information among the different users in the network, which us the real case. We show that the navigation information is very important in order to better utilize the battery and bandwidth for each user for a small number of users compared to the navigation trajectory length.

This study aims to assess the intra- and inter-rater agreement of retinal pathologies observed on fundus photographs between an ophthalmologist and two-mid level ophthalmic personnel (MLOPs). Method: A population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among subjects 60 years and above in the Bhaktapur district of Nepal. Fundus photographs of 500 eyes of 500 subjects were assessed. The macula-centered 45-degree photographs were graded twice by one ophthalmologist and two MLOPs. Intra-rater and inter-rater agreements were assessed for the ophthalmologist and the MLOPs. Result: Mean age was 70.22 years ± 6.94 (SD). Retinal pathologies were observed in 55.6 % of photographs (age-related macular degeneration: 34.2 %; diabetic retinopathy: 4.2 %; retinal vein occlusion: 3.8 %).

Our results showed that the average contents of organic phosphorus (OP) occurred in the following order: FRW soils (60.05 mg/kg) > TFW soils (38.72 mg/kg) > FFW soils (27.56 mg/kg), and accounted for less than 12% of total phosphorus (TP). In contrast to the pattern for OP, FRW soils contained lower inorganic phosphorus (IP) levels than TFW and FFW soils from April to August (p < 0.05). After the flow-sediment regulation, the TP, OP, moderately labile OP (ML-OP) ferrous/aluminum-bound IP (Fe/Al-P), and occluded IP (Oc-P) in the three wetlands decreased. The soluble and loosely bound IP (S/L-P) contents in TFW decreased, while the S/L-P contents in FRW soils increased. The levels of phosphorus fractions were affected by water and salt conditions, soil texture, exchangeable mineral element contents, and nutrient status. The Fe/Al-P and Oc-P in the three types of wetland soils were released, and the increase in S/L-P in FRW soils after the flow-sediment regulation might increase the risk of eutrophication in the coastal waters.

It is very important to observe the growth state of yeast cells for exploring the law of life movement, diagnosis and treatment of diseases, drug screening and so on. This study proposes a kind of intelligent low-cost portable cell culture platform using the microfluidic channel and the special machine learning circuit. The platform can independently complete the whole work of living cell culture and monitoring. For realizing the reusable and low-power deep learning circuit, a complement optimization neural network algorithm for hardware optimization and corresponding multi-clock-domain reusable multi-level precision neural network accelerator circuit were proposed, which can reduce the circuit area and power of convolution operation in all precisions by average 18.11% and 23.5% respectively. Besides, a dynamic multi-level precision control method based on the battery level is proposed to dynamically adjust the precision of machine learning operation, in order to balance the working time and segmentation accuracy of the culture platform. In addition, a microcolumns-based three-port input microfluidic structure was designed for better yeast culture effect. The experiment showed that the culture platform can realize yeast cell culture and achieve almost the same segmentation accuracy as the large biological laboratory with low-power and low-cost. Compared with the previous work, the cost of mass production was reduced by 88.95%, and the equipment volume was 27.1% smaller.

We start by showing Lara to be expressive complete with respect to first-order logic with aggregation. Since Lara is parameterized by a set of user-defined functions which allow to transform values in tables, the exact expressive power of the language depends on how these functions are defined. We distinguish two main cases depending on the level of genericity queries are enforced to satisfy. Under strong genericity assumptions the language cannot express matrix convolution, a very important operation in current machine learning operations. This language is also local, and thus cannot express operations such as matrix inverse that exhibit a recursive behavior. For expressing convolution, one can relax the genericity requirement by adding an underlying linear order on the domain. This, however, destroys locality and turns the expressive power of the language much more difficult to understand. In particular, although under complexity assumptions the resulting language can still not express matrix inverse, a proof of this fact without such assumptions seems challenging to obtain. © Pablo Barceló, Nelson Higuera, Jorge Pérez, and Bernardo Subercaseaux; licensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 23rd International Conference on Database Theory (ICDT 2020).",,"@CONFERENCE{Barcel√≥2020,

Socially interactive robots can help confront this situation not only by physically assisting people but also by functioning as a companion. The rising sales figures of robots point towards a trend break concerning robotics. To lower the cost for developers and to increase their interest in developing robotic applications, the RAPP approach introduces the idea of robots as platforms. RAPP (A Software Platform for Delivering Smart User Empowering Robotic Applications) aims to provide a software platform in order to support the creation and delivery of robotic applications (RApps) targeting people at risk of exclusion, especially older people. The open-source software platform will provide an API with the required functionality for the implementation of RApps. It will also provide access to the robots' sensors and actuators employing higher level commands, by adding a middleware stack with functionalities suitable for different kinds of robots. RAPP will expand the robots' computational and storage capabilities and enable machine learning operations, distributed data collection and processing. Through a special repository for RApps, the platform will support knowledge sharing among robots in order to provide personalized applications based on adaptation to individuals. The use of a common API will facilitate the development of improved applications deployable for a variety of robots. These applications target people with different needs, capabilities and expectations, while at the same time respect their privacy and autonomy.

We investigated the seasonal pattern of microbial community structure and its relationship with different P forms in the rhizosphere of three plants Scirpus planiculmis, Zizania latifolia, and Phragmites australis from the Yeyahu Wetland, China. Chloroform fumigation-extraction was used to determine the soil microbial biomass P (SMBP) and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were used to characterize microbial community composition. P fractions in rhizosphere soil samples were also observed using sequential chemical fractionation. Results showed that the average total PLFA (TPLFA) contents of rhizosphere soils ranged from 34.9 to 40.7 nmol·g−1 and were highest in summer. Bacteria were predominant in the rhizospheres of all three plants, accounting for >63% of TPLFA. Aerobic bacteria, represented by 16:0 PLFA, were most abundant. Both organic P (OP) and inorganic P (IP) accumulated in the rhizosphere during the winter die-back phase. Furthermore, both TPLFA and bacterial PLFA decreased with increases in highly resistant OP (HR-OP), occluded P (Oc-P) and Calcium-bound P (Ca-P). This suggests that bacteria play an important role in P transformation and can make use of various P forms. We also found that SMBP was significantly negatively correlated with labile OP (L-OP), moderately labile OP (ML-OP) and HR-OP, reflecting a high degree of cross correlation between SMBP and the PLFA indices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,"@ARTICLE{Teng20181266,

Basson &Jacomine Grobler","Springer, Cham",Chapter and Conference Paper,"Digital twins (DTs) and artificial intelligence (AI) have attracted significant attention and interest from research and industry communities in recent years. DTs have significant potential to support the widespread adoption of AI, in particular machine learning (ML), for more intelligent and autonomous decision making. The adoption and integration of ML into production environments are often difficult and complex, which results in ML models often underperforming relative to the development and testing environment. Machine learning operations (MLOps) overcome this underperformance by continuously deploying, integrating and (re)training ML models in production environments. This paper introduces an architecture that integrates a system of digital twins with an MLOps platform. This integration is achieved using a tight coupling between a DT (part of the DT system) and an MLOps counterpart (part of the MLOps platform). This tight coupling has the benefit of enabling each DT to have unique ML workflows, which reduces complexity within a system of many DTs and many ML workflows. The paper further introduces a Type DT Aggregate which is the aggregation of DT Instances (DTIs) of the same type. This improves scalability in large systems where many DTIs require ML.

DTs have significant potential to support the widespread adoption of AI, in particular machine learning (ML), for more intelligent and autonomous decision making. The adoption and integration of ML into production environments are often difficult and complex, which results in ML models often underperforming relative to the development and testing environment. Machine learning operations (MLOps) overcome this underperformance by continuously deploying, integrating and (re)training ML models in production environments. This paper introduces an architecture that integrates a system of digital twins with an MLOps platform. This integration is achieved using a tight coupling between a DT (part of the DT system) and an MLOps counterpart (part of the MLOps platform). This tight coupling has the benefit of enabling each DT to have unique ML workflows, which reduces complexity within a system of many DTs and many ML workflows. The paper further introduces a Type DT Aggregate which is the aggregation of DT Instances (DTIs) of the same type. This improves scalability in large systems where many DTIs require ML."",

The chapter starts by laying out the â€œgrowing painsâ€ problems that enterprises are encountering to scale AI. We highlight the relatively low maturity of post-production ML processes thus exposing enterprises to reputation, compliance, and hence financial risk. We give a historical perspective on the rise of AI. Subsequent gain in mindshare of ML Ops is explained. XAI as a solution is introduced. After a brief explanation on XAI, we delve into the experimental setup and detail the results that demonstrate the potential of using XAI to enhance ML Ops.

Springer Link,Leveraging Remote Work to Accelerate Material Informatics by Implementing Machine Learning Web Applications and Introducing Statistical Analysis Tools for Materials Scientists in a Chemical Corporation,2023,0,Yoshishige Okuno,"Springer, Cham",Chapter and Conference Paper,"Using past experimental data is advantageous in material design; however, constructing machine learning models based on this data remains challenging for materials scientists unfamiliar with machine learning. While data scientists can build appropriate machine learning models with their expertise in statistics, machine learning, and computer science, they may need more domain knowledge, particularly tacit knowledge in materials design. Therefore, collaboration between data scientists and materials scientists is necessary, but the differences in expertise between the two groups can hinder the development of materials informatics. In Resonac Corporation, we have leveraged the remote work opportunities caused by COVID-19 to accelerate the usage of materials informatics. We accomplished this by deploying the electronic laboratory notebooks and statistical analysis tool and implementing web applications with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface for materials scientists. As a result, remote work has allowed materials scientists to focus on data organization, statistical data analysis, and the usage of web applications.

These students are in primary school grade in a school of West Bengal whose mother language is Bengali. Among the primary school-going children, there exists some percentage of children who are affected with dyslexia or tend to develop reading disabilities. The fundamental deficit of these children is problem with proper letter position encoding skill in a word. This paper proposes computerized identification of children affected with disability to locate actual position of letters within a word. In the first approach, machine learning based algorithms are employed on the migration errors originating from the speech samples of a set of children from a particular school to identify the algorithm that provides the best result. Next, in order to make the diagnosis technique more robust and to validate the results obtained from the first data set of children, the set of techniques are implemented on another set of children from a different school. The speech samples of the students consist of their utterances while they speak English words. The set of words are based on Letter Position Test developed by Kohnen, Friedmann, Mc Arthur & Castles. Machine learning algorithms such as NaÃ¯ve Bayes and support vector machine presents the most efficient method of predicting the letter position impairments among children of primary school grades speaking English as their second language.

Nowadays, sophisticated analytical techniques allow companies to obtain perspicacity from data with earlier unachievable levels of accuracy and speed. Real-time analytics for big data is the capability to achieve the most suitable decisions and get significant actions at the best time. First, we present a survey of processing the big data (BD) in real time (RT) and focus on its challenges. Then, we propose an algorithm to handle BD by integration with machine learning operations in multi-user environment optimization operations, reduce maintenance costs and better speed of fault detector and provide common operations necessary to process unstructured information. There are important conditions that have been taken into a concern to guarantee the quality of services (QoS) and transmission velocity and ensure the systemâ€™s physical time synchronization and the correctness of the data processing.

abstract=""Many sources of data yield non-structured data like the Internet of things (IoT), geospatial data, E-commerce, social media, and scientific research that is not appropriate in to traditional, structured warehouses. Nowadays, sophisticated analytical techniques allow companies to obtain perspicacity from data with earlier unachievable levels of accuracy and speed. Real-time analytics for big data is the capability to achieve the most suitable decisions and get significant actions at the best time. First, we present a survey of processing the big data (BD) in real time (RT) and focus on its challenges. Then, we propose an algorithm to handle BD by integration with machine learning operations in multi-user environment optimization operations, reduce maintenance costs and better speed of fault detector and provide common operations necessary to process unstructured information. There are important conditions that have been taken into a concern to guarantee the quality of services (QoS) and transmission velocity and ensure the system's physical time synchronization and the correctness of the data processing."",

 &Simon McIntosh-Smith","Springer, Cham",Chapter and Conference Paper,"In this work, we describe our experiences trying to apply recent machine learning (ML) advances to the Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) method to predict better prolongation (interpolation) operators and accelerate solver convergence. Published work often reports results on small, unrepresentative problems, such as 1D equations or very small computational grids. To better understand the performance of these methods on more realistic data, we create a new, reusable dataset of large, sparse matrices by leveraging the recently published Thingi10K dataset of 3D geometries, along with the FTetWild mesher for creating computational meshes that are valid for use in finite element method (FEM) simulations. We run simple 3D Navier-Stokes simulations, and capture the sparse linear systems that arise.
 We consider the integration of ML approaches with established tools and solvers that support distributed computation, such as HYPRE, but achieve little success. The only approach suitable for use with unstructured grid data involves inference against a multi-layer message-passing graph neural network, which is too memory-hungry for practical use, and we find existing frameworks to be unsuitable for efficient distributed inference. Furthermore, the model prediction times far exceed the complete solver time of traditional approaches. While our focus is on inference against trained models, we also note that retraining the proposed neural networks using our dataset remains intractable.
 We conclude that these ML approaches are not yet ready for general use, and that much more research focus is required into how efficient distributed inference against such models can be incorporated into existing HPC workflows.

To detect diabetes at an early stage is also a big challenge. This detection will be helpful for decision-making process of medical system. Early prediction of diabetes helps us to save the human life from diabetes. A prolong diabetes leads to the risk of damage in vital organs of human body. So, early prediction of diabetes is very crucial in order to save human being from diabetes. Data analysis is concerned with finding a pattern from a large dataset. This helps us to build certain conclusion out of the available datasets. The analytical process can be done by different machine learning algorithms. This paper presents two sets of machine learning approach for prediction of diabetes. One of them is a classification-based algorithm, and the other one is a hybrid algorithm. In classification, we have taken the random forest algorithm. For hybrid approach, we have chosen XGBoost algorithm.

Moore,"Springer, Cham",Chapter,"As data science continues to grow in popularity, there will be an increasing need to make data science tools more scalable, flexible, and accessible. In particular, automated machine learning (AutoML) systems seek to automate the process of designing and optimizing machine learning pipelines. In this chapter, we present a genetic programming-based AutoML system called TPOT that optimizes a series of feature preprocessors and machine learning models with the goal of maximizing classification accuracy on a supervised classification problem. Further, we analyze a large database of pipelines that were previously used to solve various supervised classification problems and identify 100 short series of machine learning operations that appear the most frequently, which we call the building blocks of machine learning pipelines. We harness these building blocks to initialize TPOT with promising solutions, and find that this sensible initialization method significantly improves TPOTâ€™s performance on one benchmark at no cost of significantly degrading performance on the others. Thus, sensible initialization with machine learning pipeline building blocks shows promise for GP-based AutoML systems, and should be further refined in future work.

In this chapter, we present a genetic programming-based AutoML system called TPOT that optimizes a series of feature preprocessors and machine learning models with the goal of maximizing classification accuracy on a supervised classification problem. Further, we analyze a large database of pipelines that were previously used to solve various supervised classification problems and identify 100 short series of machine learning operations that appear the most frequently, which we call the building blocks of machine learning pipelines. We harness these building blocks to initialize TPOT with promising solutions, and find that this sensible initialization method significantly improves TPOT's performance on one benchmark at no cost of significantly degrading performance on the others. Thus, sensible initialization with machine learning pipeline building blocks shows promise for GP-based AutoML systems, and should be further refined in future work."",

 Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease of the spine and its affiliated tissues. AS mainly affects the axial bone, sacroiliac joint, hip joint, spinal facet, and adjacent ligaments. We used machine learning (ML) methods to construct diagnostic models based on blood routine examination, liver function test, and kidney function test of patients with AS. This method will help clinicians enhance diagnostic efficiency and allow patients to receive systematic treatment as soon as possible.
 Methods
 We consecutively screened 348 patients with AS through complete blood routine examination, liver function test, and kidney function test at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University according to the modified New York criteria (diagnostic criteria for AS). By using random sampling, the patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts. The training cohort included 258 patients with AS and 247 patients without AS, and the validation cohort included 90 patients with AS and 113 patients without AS. We used three ML methods (LASSO, random forest, and support vector machine recursive feature elimination) to screen feature variables and then took the intersection to obtain the prediction model. In addition, we used the prediction model on the validation cohort.
 Results
 Seven factorsâ€”erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), red blood cell count (RBC), mean platelet volume (MPV), albumin (ALB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and creatinine (Cr)â€”were selected to construct a nomogram diagnostic model through ML. In the training cohort, the C value and area under the curve (AUC) value of this nomogram was 0.878 and 0.8779462, respectively. The C value and AUC value of the nomogram in the validation cohort was 0.823 and 0.8232055, respectively. Calibration curves in the training and validation cohorts showed satisfactory agreement between nomogram predictions and actual probabilities. The decision curve analysis showed that the nonadherence nomogram was clinically useful when intervention was decided at the nonadherence possibility threshold of 1%.
 Conclusion
 Our ML model can satisfactorily predict patients with AS. This nomogram can help orthopedic surgeons devise more personalized and rational clinical strategies.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40744-022-00481-6.pdf,"@Article{Zhu2022,

 An external control arm is a cohort of control patients that are collected from data external to a single-arm trial. To provide an unbiased estimation of efficacy, the clinical profiles of patients from single and external arms should be aligned, typically using propensity score approaches. There are alternative approaches to infer efficacy based on comparisons between outcomes of single-arm patients and machine-learning predictions of control patient outcomes. These methods include G-computation and Doubly Debiased Machine Learning (DDML) and their evaluation for External Control Arms (ECA) analysis is insufficient.
 Methods
 We consider both numerical simulations and a trial replication procedure to evaluate the different statistical approaches: propensity score matching, Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW), G-computation, and DDML. The replication study relies on five type 2 diabetes randomized clinical trials granted by the Yale University Open Data Access (YODA) project. From the pool of five trials, observational experiments are artificially built by replacing a control arm from one trial by an arm originating from another trial and containing similarly-treated patients.
 Results
 Among the different statistical approaches, numerical simulations show that DDML has the smallest bias followed by G-computation. In terms of mean squared error, G-computation usually minimizes mean squared error. Compared to other methods, DDML has varying Mean Squared Error performances that improves with increasing sample sizes. For hypothesis testing, all methods control type I error and DDML is the most conservative. G-computation is the best method in terms of statistical power, and DDML has comparable power at \(n=1000\) but inferior ones for smaller sample sizes. The replication procedure also indicates that G-computation minimizes mean squared error whereas DDML has intermediate performances in between G-computation and propensity score approaches. The confidence intervals of G-computation are the narrowest whereas confidence intervals obtained with DDML are the widest for small sample sizes, which confirms its conservative nature.
 Conclusions
 For external control arm analyses, methods based on outcome prediction models can reduce estimation error and increase statistical power compared to propensity score approaches.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12874-022-01799-z.pdf,"@Article{Loiseau2022,

 ,Leon Schmidt &Stefan Verlohren",,Article,"Preeclampsia, a multisystem disorder in pregnancy, is still one of the main causes of maternal morbidity and mortality. Due to a lack of a causative therapy, an accurate prediction of women at risk for the disease and its associated adverse outcomes is of utmost importance to tailor care. In the past two decades, there have been successful improvements in screening as well as in the prediction of the disease in high-risk women. This is due to, among other things, the introduction of biomarkers such as the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio. Recently, the traditional definition of preeclampsia has been expanded based on new insights into the pathophysiology and conclusive evidence on the ability of angiogenic biomarkers to improve detection of preeclampsia-associated maternal and fetal adverse events.
 However, with the widespread availability of digital solutions, such as decision support algorithms and remote monitoring devices, a chance for a further improvement of care arises. Two lines of research and application are promising: First, on the patient side, home monitoring has the potential to transform the traditional care pathway. The importance of the ability to input and access data remotely is a key learning from the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, on the physician side, machine-learning-based decision support algorithms have been shown to improve precision in clinical decision-making. The integration of signals from patient-side remote monitoring devices into predictive algorithms that power physician-side decision support tools offers a chance to further improve care.
 The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent advances in prediction, diagnosis and monitoring of preeclampsia and its associated adverse outcomes. We will review the potential impact of the ability to access to clinical data via remote monitoring. In the combination of advanced, machine learning-based risk calculation and remote monitoring lies an unused potential that allows for a truly patient-centered care.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00404-022-06864-y.pdf,"@Article{Hackel√É¬∂er2023,

This paper outlines the effects of some risk factors of diabetes, specifically the effect of BMI, blood pressure and physical activity, using machine learning models. A survey was conducted among a random sample of Indians of various age groups and the data of 251 individuals was gathered after which ML algorithms were applied. The analysis is supported by na{\""i}ve Bayes, logistic regression and random forest algorithms. All the metrics of these algorithms are compared and discussed in this paper, thereby establishing the model having the highest accuracy for the prediction. The model with the highest accuracy and precision can be used or analysed for further computational research on diabetes mellitus."",

 The machine learning algorithm (MLA) was implemented to establish an optimal model to predict the no reflow (NR) process and in-hospital death that occurred in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI).
 Methods
 The data were obtained retrospectively from 854 STEMI patients who underwent pPCI. MLA was applied to predict the potential NR phenomenon and confirm the in-hospital mortality. A random sampling method was used to split the data into the training (66.7%) and testing (33.3%) sets. The final results were an average of 10 repeated procedures. The area under the curve (AUC) and the associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the receiver operator characteristic were measured.
 Results
 A random forest algorithm (RAN) had optimal discrimination for the NR phenomenon with an AUC of 0.7891 (95% CI: 0.7093â€“0.8688) compared with 0.6437 (95% CI: 0.5506â€“0.7368) for the decision tree (CTREE), 0.7488 (95% CI: 0.6613â€“0.8363) for the support vector machine (SVM), and 0.681 (95% CI: 0.5767â€“0.7854) for the neural network algorithm (NNET). The optimal RAN AUC for in-hospital mortality was 0.9273 (95% CI: 0.8819â€“0.9728), for SVM, 0.8935 (95% CI: 0.826â€“0.9611); NNET, 0.7756 (95% CI: 0.6559â€“0.8952); and CTREE, 0.7885 (95% CI: 0.6738â€“0.9033).
 Conclusions
 The MLA had a relatively higher performance when evaluating the NR risk and in-hospital mortality in patients with STEMI who underwent pPCI and could be utilized in clinical decision making.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12911-022-01853-2.pdf,"@Article{Deng2022,

With the indispensable role of AI in different applications, there are growing concerns over the lack of transparency and explainability. In addition, potential bias may affect the predictions of a model. This is where Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) comes into the picture. XAI increases the trust placed in an AI system by researchers, medical practitioners, and others. Thus, it leads to widespread deployment of AI in healthcare, agriculture, online mart, and many more. The aim is to enlighten practitioners on the understandability and interpretability of EAI systems using a variety of techniques available which can be very advantageous in the ICT domain. In this chapter, we present two different techniques leveraging EAI where a user has to make the right choices based on his requirements. The software architecture of the first techniques is based on a medical diagnosis model where we need to be confident enough to treat a patient as instructed by a black-box model. Another approach presents an online Mart where a reliable pricing method can be developed by ML models that can read through historical sales data. The objective here is to match buyers and sellers, to weigh animals, and to oversee their sale. However, when AI models suggest or recommend a decision, that in itself does not reveal too much (i.e., it acts as a black box). Hence, a model capable of explaining the different factors that impact the price point is essential for the needs of a user.

Thapa &Ger van Rens",,Article,"Background
 Early detection can reduce irreversible blindness from retinal diseases. This study aims to assess the intra- and inter-rater agreement of retinal pathologies observed on fundus photographs between an ophthalmologist and two-mid level ophthalmic personnel (MLOPs).
 Method
 A population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among subjects 60 years and above in the Bhaktapur district of Nepal. Fundus photographs of 500 eyes of 500 subjects were assessed. The macula-centered 45-degree photographs were graded twice by one ophthalmologist and two MLOPs. Intra-rater and inter-rater agreements were assessed for the ophthalmologist and the MLOPs.
 Result
 Mean age was 70.22 yearsâ€‰Â±â€‰6.94 (SD). Retinal pathologies were observed in 55.6 % of photographs (age-related macular degeneration: 34.2 %; diabetic retinopathy: 4.2 %; retinal vein occlusion: 3.8 %). Twelve (2.4 %) fundus pictures were non-gradable. The intra-rater agreement for overall retinal pathologies, retinal hemorrhage, and maculopathy were substantial both for the ophthalmologist as well as for the MLOPs. There was moderate inter-rater agreement between the ophthalmologist and the first MLOP on second rating for overall retinal pathologies, [kappa (k); 95 % CIâ€‰=â€‰0.59 (0.51â€“0.66)], retinal hemorrhage [k; 95â€‰% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.60 (0.41â€“0.78)], and maculopathy [k; 95â€‰% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.52 (0.43â€“0.60)]. Inter-rater agreement between the ophthalmologist and the second MLOP for second rating was moderate for overall retinal pathologies [k; 95 % CIâ€‰=â€‰0.52 (0.44â€“0.60)], substantial agreement for retinal hemorrhage [k; 95 % CIâ€‰=â€‰0. 68 (0.52â€“0.84)], moderate agreement for maculopathy [k; 95 % CIâ€‰=â€‰0.59 (0.50â€“0.67)].
 Conclusion
 There is moderate agreement between the MLOPs and the ophthalmologist in grading fundus photographs for retinal hemorrhages and maculopathy.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12886-016-0295-0.pdf,"@Article{Thapa2016,

Springer Link,Sustainable Artificial Intelligence: In Search of Technological Resilience,2022,0,Norbert Jastroch,"Springer, Cham",Chapter and Conference Paper,"Great demands are placed on the role of digital technology and artificial intelligence for sustainable development. External shocks, like the current pandemic, as well as creeping degradation, like the effects of carbon economy on the climate, need convincing concepts to control lasting negative effects on society, environment, and economy. This paper is intended to contribute to the search for ways of enabling resilience through technology.
 High expectations are being put on data driven artificial intelligence in this respect. We consider that artificial intelligence tends to fall short of scientific rigor regarding cause-and-effect relations and discuss the inherent limitations of so-called formal systems that are at the bottom of artificial intelligence systems. We take into view what data analysis and reasoning can deliver regarding the discovery of empirical phenomena, arguing that targeted, reflective data reasoning can well help discover correlations worth further theoretical investigation. We suggest combining established methods of epistemic knowledge generation with data driven artificial intelligence, i.e. human intelligence with machine-based algorithmic intelligence, in support of advanced human-systems integration. For this concept of hybrid intelligence, we provide a procedural framework.
 This methodological approach gets exemplified by the description of recently published cases of a technical application resp. Scientific practice, illustrating the potential of hybrid intelligence for the scientific as well as technical solution of problems. Concluding remarks finally draw the line to future work on sustainable artificial intelligence as a pathway to resilience delivered by technological means.

The chapter first gives an overview of data science's role in an insurance company. Then, the data science challenges in each stage of an analytics project life cycle are described. The author draws from his experience to provide solution frameworks for each of the challenges. In the end, an example is demonstrated to showcase a complex business challenge in managing the entire customer journey and calculating customer lifetime value in a life insurance company. Ethical considerations of machine learning models are also discussed."",

Prior works have proposed various AIOps solutions to support different tasks in system operations and maintenance, such as anomaly detection. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of open-source AIOps projects to understand the characteristics of AIOps in practice. We first carefully identify a set of AIOps projects from GitHub and analyze their repository metrics (e.g., the used programming languages). Then, we qualitatively examine the projects to understand their input data, analysis techniques, and goals.

To provide context, we also sample two sets of baseline projects from GitHub: a random sample of machine learning projects and a random sample of general-purposed projects. By comparing different metrics between our identified AIOps projects and these baselines, we derive meaningful insights. Our results reveal a recent and growing interest in AIOps solutions. However, the quality metrics indicate that AIOps projects suffer from more issues than our baseline projects. We also pinpoint the most common issues in AIOps approaches and discuss potential solutions to address these challenges.

Such substances primarily enter the human food chain via water, air, and soil. Among the variety of these chemicals, organochlorine pesticides have got the highest attention in breast cancer occurrence due to their potential to accumulate in both the food chain and the environment. The rationale is to propose a novel ensemble technique that is BayesNet and Random Forest Ensemble using the Voting approach (BREV). This study evaluates the levels of organochlorine pesticides in females with both benign and malignant breast cancer disease to assess the chemical exposure and its relationship with breast cancer incidence. The levels of 51 chemicals, including DDT, its metabolites, and HCH isomers, are measured in 50 females with benign and malignant breast cancer after blood and adipose tissue samples are obtained. The concentrations of chemicals in females with breast cancer malignancy is contrasted with benign patients and a prediction framework is developed applying an efficacious framework of ensemble machine learning. The findings of the experiments conclude that combining BayesNet and Random Forest algorithms applying the voting approach provides the optimal solution for breast cancer prediction. The proposed framework demonstrates success with a prediction accuracy as high as 90%.

Springer Link,AI Models and Methods in Automotive Manufacturing: A Systematic Literature Review,2023,0,Christoph Mueller &Vitaliy Mezhuyev,"Springer, Cham",Chapter,"While artificial intelligence (AI) experienced an increasing interest in industry during the past decade, the true potential and applicability of AI for automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and suppliers in real-world scenarios have not been clearly understood. Most applications of AI focus on the development of connected and autonomous cars, rather than the optimisation of automotive operations and manufacturing processes. This work, therefore, bridged this gap and shed light on the topic of AI in the context of automotive manufacturing and Industry 4.0. It aimed to promote understanding and provide up-to-date insights on specific models and methods of AI, applications that have been achieved with best practices as well as the problems that were encountered, underpinned with possible future prospects. A systematic literature review approach was adopted to ensure broad and thorough coverage of current knowledge and the identification of relevant literature on the topic. The literature search was confined to papers that were published from 2015 onwards using the databases of IEEE and ScienceDirect as primary sources, with a three-keyword search phrase to narrow down the results and increase specificity. A total of 359 papers were identified and subsequently screened for eligibility, of which 84 papers were selected for quantitative and 79 papers for qualitative analysis. The results of the quantitative analysis confirmed that the topic has markedly increased in significance, with a mere 3 papers published in 2015 and 33 papers in 2021. The majority of papers dealt with solving problems in production (39.29%), quality (35.71%) and assembly (16.67%), whereas supply chain (5.95%) and business intelligence (2.38%) were inadequately represented. The results of the qualitative analysis revealed that machine learning methods dominate current research and automotive applications, with neural networks as the most used out of more than 70 identified models. The industrial applicability was confirmed by many use cases including quality inspection, robot assembly, humanâ€“robot collaboration, material demand prediction or AI-enabled manufacturing decision making. The problems of such applications were mainly attributed to data availability and quality, model development and gaps in simulation, system integration, the complexity of automotive processes, the physical conditions of the system environment and dynamic change. For industrial applications it is thus recommended to further optimise AI methods and models, enabling a wider system integration by harvesting the potential of big data and both edge and cloud computing.

abstract=""Wheat leaf disease prevention and treatment requires an accurate and rapid classification of wheat leaf diseases and their extent. Using healthy wheat, leaf rust, crown, root rot, and wheat loose smut as research objects, this study proposes a deep learning-based technique for classifying wheat leaf diseases.

It is used to improve feature extraction in wheat leaf images. The major contribution of this study is to use a pre-trained deep learning convolutional neural network architecture as a foundation to improve and construct an automated tool for wheat leaf disease image categorization.

abstract=""The Internet is a boon for mankind but its misuse has been increasing drastically. Social networking platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram play a predominant role in expressing views by the users. Sometimes users wield abusive or inflammatory language, that may provoke readers. This paper aims to evaluate various machine learning and deep learning techniques to detect hate speech on various social media platforms in the Hinglish (English-Hindi code-mix) language. In this paper, we apply and evaluate several machine learning and deep learning methods, along with various feature extraction and word-embedding techniques, on a consolidated dataset of 20600 instances, for hate speech detection from tweets and comments in Hinglish. The experimental results reveal that deep learning models perform better than machine learning models in general. Among the deep learning models, the CNN-BiLSTM model with word2vec word embedding provides the best results. The model yields 0.876 accuracy, 0.830 precision, 0.840 recall and 0.835 F1-score. These results surpass the recent state-of-art approaches."",

 ,Shengding Sun,Prasad Tetali &Michael C. Wigal","Springer, Cham",Chapter and Conference Paper,"Understanding and developing cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence are widely seen as complex tasks and significantly strain human cognitive capacity. Cognitive fit theory is an established theory that proposes that task completion performance is enhanced when there is a congruent relationship between the problem statement and task execution. Despite efforts to simplify the tasks, the tasks may still pose a challenge when it comes to understanding and execution. This paper argues that artificial intelligence, particularly no-code artificial intelligence, can reduce human cognitive burden. The paper aims to illustrate how an artificial intelligence artefact can be used to assist humans in transforming a task with a high human cognitive load into a task with a low human cognitive load. A simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe was developed, which is easy to play and comprehend, therefore representing a low human cognitive load. This was followed by an isomorph Scrabble card game, which is more challenging to play, introducing a higher human cognitive load. Winning the latter served as the problem representation in this paper. Two design science research cycles were used during solution development. During the first cycle, an artificial intelligence agent was developed to play and win both games on behalf of the human. The coding required to develop the agent, however, introduced a high human cognitive load. Subsequently, in the second design cycle, an artificial intelligence agent that could win both games was developed using the no-code artificial intelligence platform DataRobot. Overall, this resulted in a low cognitive load in both solving the problem (winning the Scrabble card game) and developing the problem solution (artificial intelligence agent). On a theoretical level, this research contributes to information systems research by demonstrating the value of cognitive fit theory in the context of developing artificial intelligence solutions.

abstract=""The minimum linear ordering problem (MLOP) generalizes well-known combinatorial optimization problems such as minimum linear arrangement and minimum sum set cover. MLOP seeks to minimize an aggregated cost {\$}{\$}f({\backslash}cdot ){\$}{\$}due to an ordering {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sigma {\$}{\$}of the items (say [n]), i.e., {\$}{\$}{\backslash}min {\_}{\{}{\backslash}sigma {\}} {\backslash}sum {\_}{\{}i{\backslash}in [n]{\}} f(E{\_}{\{}i,{\backslash}sigma {\}}){\$}{\$}, where {\$}{\$}E{\_}{\{}i,{\backslash}sigma {\}}{\$}{\$}is the set of items mapped by {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sigma {\$}{\$}to indices [i]. Despite an extensive literature on MLOP variants and approximations for these, it was unclear whether the graphic matroid MLOP was NP-hard. We settle this question through non-trivial reductions from mininimum latency vertex cover and minimum sum vertex cover problems. We further propose a new combinatorial algorithm for approximating monotone submodular MLOP, using the theory of principal partitions. This is in contrast to the rounding algorithm by Iwata et al.

 &Liina Remm",,Article,"Background
 Different methods have been used to map species and habitat distributions. In this paper, similarity-based reasoningâ€”a methodological approach that has received less attentionâ€”was applied to estimate the distribution and coverage of Dasiphora fruticosa for the region in the Baltic states where grows the most abundant population of this species.
 Methods
 Field observations, after thinning to at least 50 m interval, included 1480 coverage estimations in the species presence locations and 8317 absence locations. Species coverage for the 750 km2 of directly unobserved area was calculated using machine learning in the similarity-based prediction system Constud. Separate predictive sets of site features (e.g. land cover, soil type) and exemplar weights were calibrated for spatial partitions of the study area (probable presence region, unclear region, proved absence region). A modified version of the Gowerâ€™s distance metric, as used in Constud, is described.
 Results
 The resulting maps depicted the predicted coverage, the certainty of decision when predicting presence or absence, and the mean similarity to the exemplar locations used while predicting. Coverage prediction errors were smaller in the unclear partitionâ€”where the species was mostly absentâ€”than in the probable presence partition, where coverage ranged from 0 to 90%.
 Conclusions
 We call for methodological comparisons using the same data set.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12898-017-0117-0.pdf,"@Article{Remm2017,

Springer Link,The Skills Framework,2017,0,Vineet Raina &Srinath Krishnamurthy,"Springer, Cham",Chapter and Conference Paper,"Intentional and accidental harms arising from the use of AI have impacted the health, safety and rights of individuals. While regulatory frameworks are being developed, there remains a lack of consensus on methods necessary to deliver safe AI. The potential for explainable AI (XAI) to contribute to the effectiveness of the regulation of AI is being increasingly examined. Regulation must include methods to ensure compliance on an ongoing basis, though there is an absence of practical proposals on how to achieve this. For XAI to be successfully incorporated into a regulatory system, the individuals who are engaged in interpreting/explaining the model to stakeholders should be sufficiently qualified for the role. Statutory professionals are prevalent in domains in which harm can be done to the health, safety and rights of individuals. The most obvious examples are doctors, engineers and lawyers. Those professionals are required to exercise skill and judgement and to defend their decision making process in the event of harm occurring. We propose that a statutory profession framework be introduced as a necessary part of the AI regulatory framework for compliance and monitoring purposes. We will refer to this new statutory professional as an AI Architect (AIA). This AIA would be responsible to ensure the risk of harm is minimised and accountable in the event that harms occur. The AIA would also be relied on to provide appropriate interpretations/explanations of XAI models to stakeholders. Further, in order to satisfy themselves that the models have been developed in a satisfactory manner, the AIA would require models to have appropriate transparency. Therefore it is likely that the introduction of an AIA system would lead to an increase in the use of XAI to enable AIA to discharge their professional obligations.

abstract=""In this chapter, we describe how to adopt different software components based on the previously presented conceptual solution and generate an integrating digital twin for a business workflow as a service extension. The focus of this software system lies in the implementation of methods from computer vision that can reliably recognize the existing objects in a process plant with their structure and interconnections. This intention benefits from numerous methods which were developed in the past years to tackle the challenge of the recognition of 3D objects under various conditions. A brief review of such methods is presented here, in particular concerning difficult environmental impact (vapor, dust, smoke, darkness, and dirt). Methods are distinguished according to data input: image, point cloud, or video. For several reasons, the implementation of an automatic object recognition procedure is realized by using existing convolutional neural networks (CNN frameworks), also known as deep learning. Literature review shows that effective and versatile automation capabilities of deep learning combined with large-scale processing may be an adequate means for the challenges of the extent and complexity of a process plant. Further is the recognition procedure described in more detail, in particular how the piping system is built up in its full complexity coming from singular components. This recognition runs iteratively in four steps with a mutual interdependence. The entire point cloud is processed by segmentation, where the pipe system is extracted. In two subsequent steps (clustering and classification) the point cloud is subdivided further to recognize the singular parts. While piping systems consist of forked structures with complex configurations and partial occlusion, the exact recognition of piping centerlines is conducted based on the position of singular parts. A robust clustering and graph-based aggregation yield a coherent pipe model before it is linked with piping and instrumentation diagram to the digital twin. Due to the high complexity and variance of the tasks, some individual tasks must run fully manually or with partial human assistance. Finally, we present how the singular steps are automated and orchestrated by using a workflow automation platform. Our workflow promises good results on pipe models with varying complexity and density both in synthetic and real cases."",

This paper presents a new design methodology for Multi-operand adders. These adders require multi-bit carries which makes their design unique. Theoretical upper bound on the size of sum and carry in a multi-operand addition for any base and any number of operands is presented in this paper. This result is used to design modular 4-operand, 4-bit adder. This module computes the partial sums using a look-up-table. These modules can be connected in a hierarchical structure to implement larger adders. Method to build a 16 bit 16 operand adder using this basic 4-bit 4-operand adder block is presented. Verilog simulation results are presented for both 4 Ã— 4 and 16 Ã— 16 adders. Design strategy used for the 16 Ã— 16 adder may further be extended to more number of bits or operands with ease, using the guidelines discussed in the paper.

Theoretical upper bound on the size of sum and carry in a multi-operand addition for any base and any number of operands is presented in this paper. This result is used to design modular 4-operand, 4-bit adder. This module computes the partial sums using a look-up-table. These modules can be connected in a hierarchical structure to implement larger adders. Method to build a 16 bit 16 operand adder using this basic 4-bit 4-operand adder block is presented. Verilog simulation results are presented for both 4¬†{\texttimes}¬†4 and 16¬†{\texttimes}¬†16 adders. Design strategy used for the 16¬†{\texttimes}¬†16 adder may further be extended to more number of bits or operands with ease, using the guidelines discussed in the paper."",

Springer Link,User-Item-Based Hybrid Recommendation System by Employing Mahout Framework,2024,0,Sutanu Paul &Dipankar Das,"Springer, Singapore",Chapter and Conference Paper,"Recommendation systems are gaining popularity nowadays. Generally, recommendations are used in multiple areas like music, movies online products, news articles, texts, study articles, search engine queries, and social networking tags. Recommender systems use machine learning techniques and data mining algorithms to predict what items should suggest to the users based on some previous information related to the users and their relations to the items. It basically offers the users a limited number of products and services which he/she would like to get among the vast amount of all available items. The growth of information on the Internet, as well as the number of visitors to Web sites, is producing many choices for a customer, but many of those are irrelevant to them. A recommendation system filters this data and refers to the filterâ€™s data to the users. The recommendation system is totally based on its training data, the performing algorithms and the recommending approach. There are many popular approaches like user-based collaborative filtering, item-based collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models. We have implemented three different architectures, item-based, user-based, and factor-based hybrid models in order to build recommender system for an artist. In order to cope up with the huge amount of data, we have used Apache Mahout on top of Hadoop. Mahout is basically a framework and an open source project of Apache. Generally, it is being used for creating scalable machine learning algorithms. Using Mahout, we can fasten the process. Mahout is ready-to-use framework, helps programmers for doing data mining tasks on a large scale of data.

The complexity of the system increases; thus, it is required to investigate the enormous number of features. However, the features that are inappropriate and (or) have some noisy data severely affect the performance of the IDSs. In this study, we have performed feature selection (FS) through a random forest algorithm for reducing irrelevant attributes. It makes the underlying task of intrusion detection effective and efficient. Later, a comparative study is carried through applying different classifiers, e.g., k Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), decision tree (DT) and Naive Bayes (NB) for measuring the different IDS metrics. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was applied on the selective features of the NSL-KDD dataset, which cut down the false alarm rate and enhanced the detection rate and the accuracy of the IDS as compared with the mentioned state-of-the-art classifiers. This study includes the accuracy, precision, false-positive rate and the detection rate as performance metrics for the IDSs. The experimental results show low computational complexity, 99.32% efficiency and 99.26% detection rate on the selected features (=10) out of a complete set (= 41).",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12046-020-1308-5.pdf,"@Article{Kunhare2020,

abstract=""The network traffic in the intrusion detection system (IDS) has unpredictable behaviour due to the high computational power.The complexity of the system increases; thus, it is required to investigate the enormous number of features. However, the features that are inappropriate and (or) have some noisy data severely affect the performance of the IDSs. In this study, we have performed feature selection (FS) through a random forest algorithm for reducing irrelevant attributes. It makes the underlying task of intrusion detection effective and efficient. Later, a comparative study is carried through applying different classifiers, e.g., k Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), decision tree (DT) and Naive Bayes (NB) for measuring the different IDS metrics.The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was applied on the selective features of the NSL-KDD dataset, which cut down the false alarm rate and enhanced the detection rate and the accuracy of the IDS as compared with the mentioned state-of-the-art classifiers. This study includes the accuracy, precision, false-positive rate and the detection rate as performance metrics for the IDSs. The experimental results show low computational complexity, 99.32{\%} efficiency and 99.26{\%} detection rate on the selected features (=10) out of a complete set (= 41)."",

The Model also highlights how the behaviour of the individuals can influence the other private spheres in the cluster, as well as the Aggregation itself, due to a network effect, and how Diffused Network Liability could help compensating for such influences without incurring into practical impossibility.

Springer Link,A big data analytical framework for analyzing solar energy receptors using evolutionary computing approach,2022,0,"Shahzad Yousaf,Imran Shafi,Sadia Din,Anand Paul &Jamil Ahmad",,Article,"Data science has been empowered with the emerging concept of big data enabling data scalability in many ways. Effective prediction systems for complex analytical problems dealing with big data can be created using evolutionary computing, associate feature selection and reduction techniques. In the current work, we put forward a big data analytical scheme to analyze solar energy receptors based on a set of features. Correct estimation of pressure loss coefficients (PLC) greatly improves the design of a solar collector. Evaluation of PLC is a time and resource consuming process as the flow rate and Reynolds number changes at every junction. Moreover, a suitable and appropriate algebraic expression is not yet defined in the laminar region of flow for approximation of the complex relationship among different geometrical features and flow variables. The overall heat gain of the solar receptor is dependent upon flow rates and flow distribution in risers. Also, the local disturbances during the flow division and combining process from manifold to risers affects the performance of the solar collector. Owing to these reasons, mostly they are calculated using experiments, primarily due to the complexity involved. The proposed big data framework involves acquiring huge feature sets at each point along the flow of thermal fluid. The data is experimentally acquired in a set of around forty features for large number of Reynolds number and discharge ratio variations. Reynolds number varies from 200 to 15,000 while discharge ratio variation is in the range of 0â€“1. Feature reduction in the big data set is done by calculating the relevancy score using ReliefF algorithm that extracts the most relevant features. Later, the framework employs a suitably selected optimal ANN architecture of layers, neurons and activation functions. The selected topology is trained using reduced features sets using Levenbergâ€“Marquardt backpropagation algorithm. Test and validation results bespeaks the efficacy of the proposed strategy and indicate that future PLC values can be forecasted close to experimental data.

Springer Link,Profiling and Cybersecurity: A Perspective from Fundamental Rightsâ€™ Protection in the EU,2024,0,Alessandra Silveira,"Springer, Cham",Chapter,"In this text we will be assessing to what extent personal data protection is related to the development of AI systems, as well as testing to what extent the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC.) enables the defense of individuals in the face of some AI applicationsâ€”especially with regard to profiling and automated decisions. Considering the GDPR regulates the processing of data of an identified or identifiable natural person, it would apply when AI systems are building on everyoneâ€™s data, as well as when such systems are used to analyze data and produce inferences on individuals (Datatilsynet - The Norwegian Data Protection Authority, Artificial intelligence and privacy, Report: Oslo, 2018). Herein lies the problem of the opacity of inferences or predictions resulting from data analysis by AI systemsâ€”inferences whose application to everyday situations determines how each of us, as personal data subjects, are perceived and evaluated by others. It is important to assess the existence of legal remedies to challenge operations that result in automated inferences that are not reasonably justified. Thus, we intend to clarify whether the GDPR adequately protects inferred data, in the light of the fundamental right to the protection of personal data provided in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (CFREU), under penalty of violating our insusceptibility to instrumentalization and objectificationâ€”in other words, human dignity itself.

abstract=""In this text we will be assessing to what extent personal data protection is related to the development of AI systems, as well as testing to what extent the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC.) enables the defense of individuals in the face of some AI applications---especially with regard to profiling and automated decisions. Considering the GDPR regulates the processing of data of an identified or identifiable natural person, it would apply when AI systems are building on everyone's data, as well as when such systems are used to analyze data and produce inferences on individuals (Datatilsynet - The Norwegian Data Protection Authority, Artificial intelligence and privacy, Report: Oslo, 2018). Herein lies the problem of the opacity of inferences or predictions resulting from data analysis by AI systems---inferences whose application to everyday situations determines how each of us, as personal data subjects, are perceived and evaluated by others. It is important to assess the existence of legal remedies to challenge operations that result in automated inferences that are not reasonably justified. Thus, we intend to clarify whether the GDPR adequately protects inferred data, in the light of the fundamental right to the protection of personal data provided in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (CFREU), under penalty of violating our insusceptibility to instrumentalization and objectification---in other words, human dignity itself."",

 Today, artificial intelligence-based computational approach is facilitating multitasking and interdisciplinary analytical research. For example, the data gathered during an analytical research project such as spectral and chromatographic data can be used in predictive experimental research. The spectral and chromatographic information plays crucial role in pharmaceutical research, especially use of instrumental analytical approaches and it consume time, man power, and money. Hence, predictive analysis would be beneficial especially in resource-limited settings.
 Main body
 Computational approaches verify data at an early phase of study in research process. Several in silico techniques for predicting analyteâ€™s spectral and chromatographic characteristics have recently been developed. Understanding of these tools may help researchers to accelerate their research with boosted confidence and prevent researchers from being misled by incorrect analytical data. In this communication, the properties of chemical compounds and its relation to chromatographic retention will be discussed, as well as the prediction technique for UV/IR/Raman/NMR spectrograms. This review looked at the reference data of chemical compounds to compare the predictive ability in silico tools along with the percentage error, limitations, and advantages.
 Conclusion
 The computational prediction of analytical characteristics offers a wide range of applications in academic research, bioanalytical method development, computational chemistry, analytical method development, data analysis approaches, material characterization, and validation process.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s43094-023-00537-6.pdf,"@Article{Malarvannan2023,

These models are classified into two types: single-stage detectors and two-stage detectors. The single-stage detectors just need one pass through the model to anticipate all the bounding boxes, whereas the two-stage detectors require to first estimate the image portions where the object could be located. Due to their speed and simplicity, single-stage anchor-based models are used in many industrial settings. Training such models require bounding boxes that describe the spatial location of an object, which are usually drawn by an expert. However, the question remains, how much area should be considered when drawing the bounding boxes? In this paper, we demonstrate the effects that the size and placement of a rectangular bounding box can have on the performance of the anchor-based models. For this, we first perform experiments on a synthetically generated binary dataset and then on a real-world object detection dataset. Our results show that fixing the size of the bounding boxes can help in improving the performance of the model in the case of single class object detection (approximately 50% improvement in mAP@[.5:.95] for real world dataset).

Rassam,"Springer, Cham",Chapter and Conference Paper,"Anomalous data detection is an important task for ensuring the quality of data in many real-world applications. Medical healthcare services are one such application where Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) is used to track human health situations. Such tracking is achieved by collecting and monitoring the basic physiological vital signs and making them available to the healthcare givers to assess the criticality status of patients, especially in Intensive care units (ICU). Various anomaly detection approaches have been proposed for detecting anomalies collected in WBAN such as statistical, machine learning and deep learning techniques.

In this paper, an Isolation Forest-based anomaly detection approach for WBAN (iForestBAN-AD) model is proposed. The iForest technique is fully unsupervised and does not employ any distance measure or density function like most existing techniques and rather detects anomalies based on the concept of isolation. To evaluate the proposed approach, experiments on data samples from real world physiological network records (Physionet) were conducted.

Wichtmann,Anton Faron,Matthias F. Froelich,Fabian Tollens,Helena L. GeiÃŸler,Wolfgang Block,Julian A. Luetkens,Ulrike I. Attenberger &Alois M. Sprinkart",,Article,"Objectives
 To develop a pipeline for automated body composition analysis and skeletal muscle assessment with integrated quality control for large-scale application in opportunistic imaging.
 Methods
 First, a convolutional neural network for extraction of a single slice at the L3/L4 lumbar level was developed on CT scans of 240 patients applying the nnU-Net framework. Second, a 2D competitive dense fully convolutional U-Net for segmentation of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT, SAT), skeletal muscle (SM), and subsequent determination of fatty muscle fraction (FMF) was developed on single CT slices of 1143 patients. For both steps, automated quality control was integrated by a logistic regression model classifying the presence of L3/L4 and a linear regression model predicting the segmentation quality in terms of Dice score. To evaluate the performance of the entire pipeline end-to-end, body composition metrics, and FMF were compared to manual analyses including 364 patients from two centers.
 Results
 Excellent results were observed for slice extraction (z-deviationâ€‰=â€‰2.46â€‰Â±â€‰6.20 mm) and segmentation (Dice score for SMâ€‰=â€‰0.95â€‰Â±â€‰0.04, VATâ€‰=â€‰0.98â€‰Â±â€‰0.02, SATâ€‰=â€‰0.97â€‰Â±â€‰0.04) on the dual-center test set excluding cases with artifacts due to metallic implants. No data were excluded for end-to-end performance analyses. With a restrictive setting of the integrated segmentation quality control, 39 of 364 patients were excluded containing 8 cases with metallic implants. This setting ensured a high agreement between manual and fully automated analyses with mean relative area deviations of Î”SMâ€‰=â€‰3.3â€‰Â±â€‰4.1%, Î”VATâ€‰=â€‰3.0â€‰Â±â€‰4.7%, Î”SATâ€‰=â€‰2.7â€‰Â±â€‰4.3%, and Î”FMFâ€‰=â€‰4.3â€‰Â±â€‰4.4%.
 Conclusions
 This study presents an end-to-end automated deep learning pipeline for large-scale opportunistic assessment of body composition metrics and sarcopenia biomarkers in clinical routine.
 Key Points
 â€¢ Body composition metrics and skeletal muscle quality can be opportunistically determined from routine abdominal CT scans.
 â€¢ A pipeline consisting of two convolutional neural networks allows an end-to-end automated analysis.
 â€¢ Machine-learning-based quality control ensures high agreement between manual and automatic analysis.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00330-021-08313-x.pdf,"@Article{Nowak2022,

We study how social network algorithms behave on sparsified versions of such networks with two motivations in mind:
 1.
 In practice, it is challenging to collect, store and process the entire often constantly growing network, so it is important to understand how algorithms behave on incomplete views of a network.
 2.
 Even if one has the full network, algorithms may be infeasible at such large scale, and the only option may be to sparsify the networks to make them computationally tractable while still maintaining the fidelity of the social network algorithms.
 We present a variety of methods for sparsifying a network based on linear regression and linear algebraic sampling for graph reconstruction. We compare the methods against one another with respect to clustering. Specifically, given a graph G, we sample the columns of its adjacency matrix and reconstruct the remaining columns using only those sampled columns to obtain Äœ, the reconstructed approximation of G. We then perform clustering on G and Äœ to get two sets of clusters and compute their modularity, fitness and centrality. Our thorough experimentation reveals that graphs reconstructed through our methodology preserve (in some cases, even improve) community structure while being orders of magnitude more efficient both in storage and computation. We show similar results if the target is prominence of nodes rather than clusters.

The results show that STSNet can simultaneously provide effective ENSO prediction for 16 months, with higher correlation and lower deviation compared with other deep learning models."",

Itâ€™s also increasing common for clients to perform collaborative mining to maximize profits. However, due to the rise of privacy leakage issues, the data contributed by clients should be encrypted under their own keys. This paper focuses on privacy-preserving k-means clustering over the joint datasets from multiple sources. Unfortunately, existing secure outsourcing protocols are either restricted to a single key setting or quite inefficient because of frequent client-to-server interactions, making it impractical for wide application. To address these issues, we propose a set of secure building blocks and outsourced clustering protocol under Spark framework. Theoretical analysis shows that our scheme protects the confidentiality of the joint database and mining results in the standard threat model with small computation and communication overhead.

Springer Link,Selection of Auxiliary Objectives Using Landscape Features and Offline Learned Classifier,2023,0,Anton Bassin &Arina Buzdalova,"Springer, Cham",Chapter and Conference Paper,"In order to increase the performance of an evolutionary algorithm, additional auxiliary optimization objectives may be added. It is hard to predict which auxiliary objectives will be the most efficient at different stages of optimization. Thus, the problem of dynamic selection between auxiliary objectives appears. This paper proposes a new method for efficient selection of auxiliary objectives, which uses fitness landscape information and problem meta-features. An offline learned meta-classifier is used to dynamically predict the most efficient auxiliary objective during the main optimization run performed by an evolutionary algorithm. An empirical evaluation on two benchmark combinatorial optimization problems (Traveling Salesman and Job Shop Scheduling problems) shows that the proposed approach outperforms similar known methods of auxiliary objective selection.

abstract=""In order to increase the performance of an evolutionary algorithm, additional auxiliary optimization objectives may be added. It is hard to predict which auxiliary objectives will be the most efficient at different stages of optimization. Thus, the problem of dynamic selection between auxiliary objectives appears. This paper proposes a new method for efficient selection of auxiliary objectives, which uses fitness landscape information and problem meta-features. An offline learned meta-classifier is used to dynamically predict the most efficient auxiliary objective during the main optimization run performed by an evolutionary algorithm. An empirical evaluation on two benchmark combinatorial optimization problems (Traveling Salesman and Job Shop Scheduling problems) shows that the proposed approach outperforms similar known methods of auxiliary objective selection."",

AI Incident Management (AIIM) becomes therefore a set of practices and tools to resolve incidents by means of AI-enabled organizational processes and methodologies. The software automation of AIIM could reduce unplanned interruptions of service and let customers resume their work as quick as possible.
 While several techniques were presented in the literature to automatically identify the problems described in incident tickets by customers, this paper focuses on the qualitative analysis of the provided descriptions and on using such analysis within the context of an AI-enabled business organizational process. When an incident ticket does not describe properly the problem, the analyst must ask the customer for additional details which could require several long-lasting interactions. This paper overviews ACQUA, an AIIM approach that uses machine-learning to automatically assess the quality of ticket descriptions with the goals of removing the need of additional communications and guiding the customers to properly describe the incident.

That is, the size of the resultant extended formulation depends not explicitly on the number m of the original constraints, but on its decision diagram representation.

 &Andrea Bongini","Springer, Cham",Chapter,"In recent years, the massive development of digital technologies for capturing data from sensors, located both in-side buildings and in the urban environment, made necessary an expansion of the traditional semantic domains of the construction industry with reference to BIM-based information management processes. The integration of data between BIM models and IoT devices enables the creation of Digital Twins (DTs) of built heritage assets, capable of connecting data coming continuously from sensors with digital models of those assets. This enables the management of large masses of data produced at various stages of the building lifecycle, making it possible to experiment with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data analytics for predictive analysis of building system behavior and performance. This paper presents the results of a research, which aimed to develop a methodological and operational workflow for the creation of Digital Twin of buildings. The interoperability offered by the IFC schema allowed the use of an external platform for linking different semantic fields.

abstract=""In recent years, the massive development of digital technologies for capturing data from sensors, located both in-side buildings and in the urban environment, made necessary an expansion of the traditional semantic domains of the construction industry with reference to BIM-based information management processes. The integration of data between BIM models and IoT devices enables the creation of Digital Twins (DTs) of built heritage assets, capable of connecting data coming continuously from sensors with digital models of those assets. This enables the management of large masses of data produced at various stages of the building lifecycle, making it possible to experiment with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data analytics for predictive analysis of building system behavior and performance. This paper presents the results of a research, which aimed to develop a methodological and operational workflow for the creation of Digital Twin of buildings. The interoperability offered by the IFC schema allowed the use of an external platform for linking different semantic fields. Thus, on the one hand, a federated BIM model was created, and on the other hand, real-time acquired data from a system of sensors in-stalled at different locations in the building were recorded and stored in a central server."",

Therefore, algorithms need to be trained with labeled input to recognize differences in input images. We simplify this labeling process using voice commands in Mixed Reality. The generated input from the mixed-reality labeling is put into a convolutional neural network. The latter is trained to classify the images with different objects. In this work, we describe the development of this mixed-reality prototype with its backend architecture. Furthermore, we test the classification robustness with image distortion filters. We validated our approach with format parts from a blister machine provided by a pharmaceutical packaging company in Germany.

Springer Link,â€œAutonomous weaponsâ€ as a geopolitical signifier in a national power play: analysing AI imaginaries in Chinese and US military policies,2022,0,Thomas Christian BÃ¤chle &Jascha Bareis,,Article,"â€œAutonomous weapon systemsâ€ (AWS) have been subject to intense discussions for years. Numerous political, academic and legal actors are debating their consequences, with many calling for strict regulation or even a global ban. Surprisingly, it often remains unclear which technologies the term AWS refers to and also in what sense these systems can be characterised as autonomous at all. Despite being feared by many, weapons that are completely self-governing and beyond human control are more of a conceptual possibility than an actual military reality.
 As will be argued, the conflicting interpretations of AWS are largely the result of the diverse meanings that are constructed in political discourses. These interpretations convert specific understandings of AI into strategic assets and consequently hinder the establishment of common ethical standards and legal regulations. In particular, this article looks at the publicly available military AI strategies and position papers by China and the USA. It analyses how AWS technologies, understood as evoking sociotechnical imaginaries, are politicised to serve particular national interests.
 The article presents the current theoretical debate, which has sought to find a functional definition of AWS that is sufficiently unambiguous for regulatory or military contexts. Approaching AWS as a phenomenon that is embedded in a particular sociotechnical imaginary, however, flags up the ways in which nation states portray themselves as part of a global AI race, competing over economic, military and geopolitical advantages. Nation states do not just enforce their geopolitical ambitions through a fierce realpolitik rhetoric but also play around with ambiguities in definitions. This especially holds true for China and the USA, since they are regarded and regard themselves as hegemonic antagonists, presenting competing self-conceptions that are apparent in their histories, political doctrines and identities. The way they showcase their AI-driven military prowess indicates an ambivalent rhetoric of legal sobriety, tech-regulation and aggressive national dominance. AWS take on the role of signifiers that are employed to foster political legitimacy or to spark deliberate confusion and deterrence.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40309-022-00202-w.pdf,"@Article{B√É¬§chle2022,

 &Emanuele Frontoni","Springer, Cham",Chapter and Conference Paper,"In recent years, the need for contactless and sustainable systems has become increasingly relevant. The traditional water dispensers, which require contact with the dispenser and often involve single-use plastic cups or bottles, are not only unhygienic but also contribute to environmental pollution. This paper presents a touchless water dispenser system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to control the dispensing of water or any liquid beverage. The system is designed to fill a container under the nozzle, dispense water when the container is aligned with the flow, and stop dispensing when the container is full, all without requiring any physical contact. This approach ensures compliance with hygiene regulations and promotes environmental sustainability by eliminating the need for plastic bottles or cups, making it a â€œplastic-freeâ€ and â€œzero wasteâ€ system. The prototype is based on a computer vision approach that employs an RGB camera and a Raspberry Pi board, which allows for real-time image processing and machine learning operations. The system uses image processing techniques to detect the presence of a container under the nozzle and then utilizes AI algorithms to control the flow of liquid. The system is trained using machine learning models and optimized to ensure accuracy and efficiency. We discuss the development and implementation of the touchless water dispenser system, including the hardware and software components used, the algorithms employed, and the testing and evaluation of the system. The results of our experiments show that the touchless water dispenser system is highly accurate and efficient, and it offers a safe and sustainable alternative to traditional water dispensers.

The aim of the study was to compare the effect of a multimodal low-opioid anesthesia protocol (MLOP) on early postoperative complications during on-pump CABG.
 Methods
 A single-center prospective cohort study including 120 patients undergoing on-pump CABG aged 18 to 65 years, divided into two groups according to undergoing MLOP or routine-opioid anesthesia protocol (ROP). The analyzed parameters were plasma IL-6 levels, complications, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit stay, and hospitalization.
 Results
 In the MLOP group, the levels of IL-6 at the end of the surgery were 25.6% significantly lower compared to the ROP group (33.4â€‰Â±â€‰9.4 vs. 44.9â€‰Â±â€‰15.9, pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001), the duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly shorter (2.0 (2.0; 3.0) h vs. 4.0 (3.0; 5.0) h, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), the incidence of low cardiac output syndrome was almost two and half times lower (7 (11.7%) vs. 16 (26.7%), pâ€‰=â€‰0.037), and also the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was significantly lower (9 (15.0%) vs. 19 (31.7%), pâ€‰=â€‰0.031).
 Conclusion
 Our study confirms that using MLOP was characterized by significantly lower levels of IL-6 at the end of surgery and a lower incidence of low cardiac output syndrome and postoperative atrial fibrillation than ROP.

Springer Link,Hydrogels from norbornene-functionalized carboxymethyl cellulose using a UV-initiated thiol-ene click reaction,2023,0,Thomas V. C. McOscar &William M. Gramlich,,Article,"Abstract
 Chemically crosslinked cellulose hydrogels have wide applications in agriculture and biomedicine, but most crosslinking methods involve potentially toxic crosslinking chemistries or lack significant control over the final modulus of the material. To overcome these challenges, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) hydrogels were synthesized utilizing thiol-ene click chemistry. CMC was functionalized with norbornene groups through a base catalyzed, water-borne functionalization reaction with carbic anhydride, yielding a reactive norbornene group. Both reaction pH and anhydride concentration could be used to control the degree of norbornene functionalization of CMC up to 45% norbornene functionalization per CMC repeat unit. This new norbornene functionalized CMC (cCMC) was crosslinked though a UV-light initiated thiol-ene reaction with a 2,2â€²-(ethylenedioxy)diethanethiol (DEG) crosslinker. Both the ratio of thiols to norbornenes and the irradiation time could be varied at a constant polymer concentration to control the modulus over an order of magnitude. Interestingly, thiol to norbornene ratios of 1:2 and 1:1 yielded the same modulus values, which was attributed to the crosslinking limiting chain mobility early in the reaction and preventing increased crosslink density as the reaction progressed. Hydrolytic degradation of the hydrogels yielded two degradation regimes of initial burst release and continuous daily release. Burst release behavior was tied to the thiol to norbornene ratio used to fabricate the hydrogel, while the daily degradation rate could be correlated to the crosslinking density. Due to its straightforward synthesis and significant control over modulus and degradation rates, cCMC offers high utility for future applications where cellulose derived hydrogels are needed.

abstract=""A developing country in South Asia with rugged terrain and a low ratio of ophthalmologists to population, Nepal is an eminent example of a country in which teleophthalmology holds great promise. In this beautiful country that comprises jungles in the south and the world's highest peaks in the north, travel can be exceedingly difficult for patients in remote areas, though high speed cellular data and WiFi are available in almost all areas inhabited by people. While cataract blindness has been reduced over the past decades via high volume surgical outreach initiatives, retinal and optic nerve pathology as a cause of reduced vision and blindness remains relatively unaddressed, except in the largest cities at tertiary eye care facilities. Numerous studies have shown promise in the use of teleophthalmology, and demonstrated the potential benefits of compact, portable imaging and testing technologies, though few of these initiatives have taken hold in the long term. Current efforts in the country are being directed toward leveraging mid-level ophthalmic personnel working in smaller cities and villages to use imaging and teleconferencing modalities in order to better serve patients in those areas via remote consultation with ophthalmologists."",

However, the potential of artificial intelligence is often associated with a difficulty to understand the logic veiling behind its decision making. This is essentially the premise upon which XAI or eXplainable AI functions. In this field of study, researchers attempt to streamline techniques to provide an explanation for the decisions that the machines make. We endeavor to delve deeper into what explainable means and the repercussions of the lack of definition associated with the term. We intend to show in this paper that an evaluation system based solely on how easy it is to understand an explanation, without taking into account aspects such as fidelity, might produce potentially harmful explanation interfaces.

Siji Rani,"Springer, Singapore",Chapter and Conference Paper,"Product recommendation becomes to be one most revenue-generating technologies that every e-commerce website is using. For enhancing the purchase rate and user engagement, various product recommendations are available in the e-commerce website. Most of the external contexts are also taken into consideration for the product recommendation. This type of external context analysis sometimes will provide better recommendations when compared to the user-generated data. This paper proposes an idea of product recommendation using the weather. Here we predict the weather for the coming days using logistic regression and analyze the weather using big data analytics.

abstract=""Artificial intelligence has virtually pervaded every field and its adaptation is a catalyst for organizational growth. However, the potential of artificial intelligence is often associated with a difficulty to understand the logic veiling behind its decision making. This is essentially the premise upon which XAI or eXplainable AI functions. In this field of study, researchers attempt to streamline techniques to provide an explanation for the decisions that the machines make. We endeavor to delve deeper into what explainable means and the repercussions of the lack of definition associated with the term. We intend to show in this paper that an evaluation system based solely on how easy it is to understand an explanation, without taking into account aspects such as fidelity, might produce potentially harmful explanation interfaces."",

In this study, the rainfall trends over Punjab state have been analysed for the time period 1987â€“2020 using the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) version 2.0 final, in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. CHIRPS integrate 0.05Â° resolution satellite imagery with in situ station data to create a gridded time series rainfall data set. Doing such big data analysis for a complete state is a very complex job as it involves a lot of time, storage and computing power.

Springer Link,Distinguishing between Crohnâ€™s disease and ulcerative colitis using deep learning models with interpretability,2023,0,JosÃ© MaurÃ­cio &InÃªs Domingues,,Article,"Crohnâ€™s disease and ulcerative colitis are two chronic diseases that cause inflammation in the tissues of the entire gastrointestinal tract and are described by the term inflammatory bowel disease. Gastroenterologists find it difficult to evaluate endoscopic images to recognise the characteristics of the two chronic diseases. Therefore, this work aims to build a dataset with images of Crohnâ€™s disease and ulcerative colitis (collected from the public datasets LIMUC, HyperKvasir and CrohnIPI) and train deep learning models (five CNNs and six ViTs) to develop a tool capable of helping doctors to distinguish the type of inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, as these architectures will be too heavy to work in a hospital context, in this work, we are looking to use knowledge distillation to create lighter and simpler architectures with the same precision as the pre-trained architectures used in this study. During this process, it is important to evaluate and interpret the pre-trained architectures before the distillation process, and the architectures resulting from knowledge distillation to ensure that we can maintain performance and that the information learnt by both architectures are similar. It is concluded that is possible to reduce 25x the number of parameters while maintaining good performance and reducing the inference time by 5.32 s. Allied with this, through the interpretability of the models was concluded that both before and after the knowledge distillation are possible to identify ulcers, bleeding situations, and lesions caused by the inflammation of the disease.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10044-023-01206-3.pdf,"@InProceedings{10.1007/978-981-16-5747-4_41,

They allow not only the pipeline definition but also the code generation needed to execute the project providing an easy way to carry out the projects even for non-expert users. However, there are still some challenges that these tools do not address yet, e.g. the possibility of executing pipelines defined by using different tools or execute them in different environments (reproducibility and replicability) or models validation and verification by identifying inconsistent operations (intentionality). In order to alleviate these problems, this paper presents a Model-Driven framework for the definition of data science pipelines independent of the particular execution platform and tools. The framework relies on the separation of the pipeline definition into two different modelling layers: conceptual, where the data scientist may specify all the data and models operations to be carried out by the pipeline; operational, where the data engineer may describe the execution environment details where the operations (defined in the conceptual part) will be implemented. Based on this abstract definition and layers separation, the approach allows: the usage of different tools improving, thus, process replicability; the automation of the process execution, enhancing process reproducibility; and the definition of model verification rules, providing intentionality restrictions.

abstract=""The search for alternatives to traditional Li-ion batteries has sparked interest in the chemistry and manufacturing of solid-state Li-ion conductors. Li-ion conductors are traditionally processed as millimetre-sized pellets using conventional ceramic-processing routes. However, in thin-film form, Li-ion conductors offer applications beyond energy storage, including artificial intelligence, in-memory computing and smart sensing. In this Review, we examine the chemistry and thin-film processing of Li oxides and discuss challenges and opportunities for the integration of Li-oxide films in microbatteries for energy storage, neuromorphic computation mimicking human-brain operations and sensors for toxins and greenhouse gases. Li oxides in thin-film form provide fast Li-ion movement and connected electronic-state changes, which improve energy and information density and increase cycle speed and endurance of Li-conductor-based devices. Finally, we provide a future vision of lithionic devices integrating Li-based ceramics for the design of microdevices beyond batteries."",

 A simplicial complex is constructed for data for a given distance parameter. This complex encodes information about the local proximity of data points. A singular homology value can be calculated from this simplicial complex. Extending this idea, the distance parameter is given for a range of values, and the homology is calculated over this range. The persistent homology is a representation of how the homological features of the data persist over this interval. The result is characteristic to the data. A method that allows for the comparison of the persistent homology for different data sets is also discussed.

Springer Link,Local extreme complete trio pattern for multimedia image retrieval system,2023,1,"T. Gowdridge,N. Dervilis &K. Worden","Springer, Cham",Article,"Purpose
 To better control and manage phosphorus (P) in the aquatic environment of the Qiuxi River, a typical river severely influenced by anthropogenic activities in southwest China, the morphological characteristics and the release potential of P in sediments during different water seasons were determined.
 Materials and methods
 The overlying water and sediment samples were collected from the Qiuxi River in the normal-water season (NWS), low-water season (LWS), and high-water season (HWS), and physicochemical properties were quantified. Total phosphorus (TP) in sediment and the inorganic phosphorus (Pi) fraction were analyzed using the standard measures technology (SMT) procedure, and organic phosphorus (Po) was further determined to be labile Po (LOP), moderately labile Po (MLOP), or non-labile Po (NLOP). The release potential of P from the sediments was studied by experiments under simulated conditions.
 Results and discussion
 The results showed that P pollution in the Qiuxi River was the most serious during the LWS, with mean TP concentrations in the sediment of 854.6 mg kgâˆ’1, and the release risk of the sediment P was also highest during this water season. The variation in P concentration was significantly influenced by the discharge of domestic sewage, agricultural diffusion, flow rate, and OM. The concentrations of P fractions varied with water season, but Pi was constantly higher than Po. HCl-extractable Pi (HCl-Pi) accounted for most of the P in the sediments, which was related to its characteristics and the geographical location of the Qiuxi River. The maximum P release (Rmax) was 25.9 mg kgâˆ’1 in the LWS and 15.3 mg kgâˆ’1 in the HWS, which were positively correlated with the TP (r2â€‰=â€‰0.848, pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) and OM (r2â€‰=â€‰0.847, pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) concentrations in the sediments and explained why the release risk of the sediment P in the LWS was higher than that in the HWS.
 Conclusions
 Phosphorus pollution and the P release potential in the sediments of the Qiuxi River were most severe in the LWS, so more effective measures to restrain the release of P should be taken during the LWS. Moreover, OM in sediments should be given more attention owing to its significantly positive correlation with the risk of P release.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-76004-5.pdf,"@Article{Chen2021,

 Effects of aeration on distribution and release potential of organic phosphorus in sediments are of great significance. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of fine bubble aeration at the sedimentâ€’water interface on species distributions of organic phosphorus and related microbial activities in the sediments from Nanfei River, a seriously polluted urban river in Hefei City, Anhui Province, China.
 Materials and methods
 A simulation experiment with a precision oxygen distribution system with fine bubble was applied and the sediments in system were taken out at intervals to test various indicators, mainly including the contents of phosphorus, species distribution of organic phosphorus, microbial biomass (MBC), and alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), as well as the number of phosphate solubilizing bacteria.
 Results
 The results showed that the content of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased in the sediments, along with the decrease of pH and the significant increase of oxidationâ€“reduction potential (ORP). The content of total phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus in the surface sediments generally presented a downward trend when the content of organic phosphorus increased first and then decreased during aeration. The variation trends of liable organic phosphorus and moderately labile organic phosphorus were similar to organic phosphorus, while the content of non-labile organic phosphorus was slightly decreased. In addition, the MBC and APA increased. The number of organic phosphorus mineralizing bacteria (OPB) increased while that of inorganic phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (IPB) decreased, and the number of OPB was significantly correlated to APA, which corresponds to the mineralization mechanism of organic phosphorus.
 Conclusions
 There were two stages of phosphorus transformation in the surface sediments during the aeration treatment: the stabilization of inorganic phosphorus in the early stage and the mineralization of organic phosphorus latterly, which means an increased risk of phosphorus release into the water in the late stage. Therefore, the fine bubble aeration treatment at the sedimentâ€’water interface applied to controlling the internal pollution of water bodies should be considered, especially focusing on the strict control of the aeration time. Overall, the present study can provide scientific guidance for in situ remediation of heavily polluted sediments.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-97478-1.pdf,"@Article{Yang2021,

 To compare the effects of maize stover and its biochar on soil P fractions and investigate the effects of different stover incorporation practices (direct return or pyrolysis) on the transformation of soil P fractions after a long-term field experiment.
 Materials and methods
 Total P, Olsen-P, inorganic P fractions, and organic P fractions were analyzed via a 5-year field experiment growing maize. The treatments were as follows: CK0 (no fertilizer application or amendment), CK (application of mineral NPK fertilizer), ST (application of maize stover at 7.5 t haâˆ’1 along with mineral NPK fertilizer), and BC (application of biochar at 2.63 t haâˆ’1, a rate approximately equivalent to a maize stover biomass of 7.5 t haâˆ’1; the biochar was charred according to a 35% output ratio in the factory). All treatments received N mineral fertilizer at 120 kg N haâˆ’1, P mineral fertilizer at 26 kg P haâˆ’1, and K mineral fertilizer at 50 kg K haâˆ’1 annually.
 Results and discussion
 Relative to the initial fractions in 2013, biochar generally increased the inorganic P fractions (Ca8-P, Ca10-P, Al-P, and Fe-P), and maize stover generally increased the organic P fractions (MLOP, MROP, and HROP), while both maize stover and its biochar significantly decreased O-P in the soil. After 5 years (in 2017), relative to CK treatment, amendment with maize stover and its biochar increased total P and decreased Olsen-P. The total inorganic P, Ca8-P, and Fe-P were significantly increased by biochar. Ca2-P and O-P were significantly decreased by maize stover and its biochar. Total organic P was increased with maize stover and biochar amendment. LOP and HROP were significantly increased under biochar application, and all organic P fractions were significantly increased under maize stover amendment.
 Conclusions
 The application of maize stover and its biochar affected both organic and inorganic phosphorus fractions; biochar had a more advantageous effect on the soil inorganic P fractions, while stover had a greater effect on the content of organic P fractions.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11356-020-09716-x.pdf,"@Article{Cao2020,

 &H.-S. Philip Wong","Springer, Cham",Chapter and Conference Paper,"There has been a long-standing interest in computing diverse solutions to optimization problems. In 1995 J. Krarup [28] posed the problem of finding k-edge disjoint Hamiltonian Circuits of minimum total weight, called the peripatetic salesman problem (PSP). Since then researchers have investigated the complexity of finding diverse solutions to spanning trees, paths, vertex covers, matchings, and more. Unlike the PSP that has a constraint on the total weight of the solutions, recent work has involved finding diverse solutions that are all optimal.
 However, sometimes the space of exact solutions may be too small to achieve sufficient diversity. Motivated by this, we initiate the study of obtaining sufficiently-diverse, yet approximately-optimal solutions to optimization problems. Formally, given an integer k, an approximation factor c, and an instance I of an optimization problem, we aim to obtain a set of k solutions to I that a) are all c approximately-optimal for I and b) maximize the diversity of the k solutions. Finding such solutions, therefore, requires a better understanding of the global landscape of the optimization function.
 Given a metric on the space of solutions, and the diversity measure as the sum of pairwise distances between solutions, we first provide a general reduction to an associated budget-constrained optimization (BCO) problem, where one objective function is to optimized subject to a bound on the second objective function. We then prove that bi-approximations to the BCO can be used to give bi-approximations to the diverse approximately optimal solutions problem.
 As applications of our result, we present polynomial time approximation algorithms for several problems such as diverse c-approximate maximum matchings, \(s-t\) shortest paths, global min-cut, and minimum weight bases of a matroid. The last result gives us diverse c-approximate minimum spanning trees, advancing a step towards achieving diverse c-approximate TSP tours.
 We also explore the connection to the field of multiobjective optimization and show that the class of problems to which our result applies includes those for which the associated DUALRESTRICT problem defined by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [35], and recently explored by Herzel et al. [26] can be solved in polynomial time.

At the same time, advances in computing, storage, communication, and big data technologies are making it possible to collect, store, process, analyze and visualize enormous volumes of data at scale and at speed. The convergence of Operations Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT), powered by innovative data analytics, holds the promise of using insights derived from these rich types of data to better manage our systems, resources, environment, health, social infrastructure, and industrial operations. Opportunities to apply innovative analytics abound in many industries (e.g., manufacturing, power distribution, oil and gas exploration and production, telecommunication, healthcare, agriculture, mining) and similarly in government (e.g., homeland security, smart cities, public transportation, accountable care). In developing several such applications over the years, we have come to realize that existing benchmarks for decision support, streaming data, event processing, or distributed processing are not adequate for industrial big data applications. One primary reason being that these benchmarks individually address narrow range of data and analytics processing needs of industrial big data applications. In this paper, we outline an approach we are taking to defining a benchmark that is motivated by typical industrial operations scenarios. We describe the main issues we are considering for the benchmark, including the typical data and processing requirements; representative queries and analytics operations over streaming and stored, structured and unstructured data; and the proposed simulator data architecture.

Springer Link,The regime and P availability of omitting P fertilizer application for rice in rice/wheat rotation in the Taihu Lake Region of southern China,2017,0,"Yu Wang,Xu Zhao,Lei Wang,Yujun Wang,Wei Li,Shenqiang Wang &Guangxi Xing",,Article,"Purpose
 In the Taihu Lake Region (TLR) of China, farmersâ€™ injudicious and excessive use of phosphorus (P) fertilizer has led to a dramatic spike in P accumulation. In view of that, the water flooding practice can increase soil P release and enhance P availability in rice season, compared with the strong P fixation in wheat season; it seems possible to save P fertilizer in rice season with the aim of reducing P loads without any crop yield declines.
 Materials and methods
 To validate this possibility, a 4-year pot experiment encompassing eight rice/wheat seasons and using four paddy soils with varying Olsen-P contents (6.16 to 40.95 mg kgâˆ’1) was conducted to compare rice/wheat yield, inorganic and organic P accumulation under four different P regimes, P fertilization for both rice and wheat (PRâ€‰+â€‰W; conventional practice), P fertilization only for wheat (PW), P fertilization only for rice (PR), and no P fertilization for both seasons (Pzero).
 Results and discussion
 Compared with conventional PRâ€‰+â€‰W treatment, PR treatment significantly decreased wheat yields, especially in medium- and low-P soils, with an Olsen-P concentrate decline of 34.4â€“62.8 %. In contrast, PW treatment showed no significant difference in the rice/wheat yields over 4 years irrespective of high-, medium-, and low-P-concentrated soils, despite the soil Olsen-P concentration declining by 34.9â€“64.4 %. This highlights the feasibility of omitting P fertilizer application to flooded rice for at least 4 years in rice/wheat cropping paddy fields while maintaining crop yields and reducing environmental risk. In four paddy soils, available inorganic P was the dominant effective P source and increased with the concentration of Olsen-P. Without P fertilization over time, the concentration of soil inorganic P fractions declined and organic P remained relatively constant.
 Conclusions
 According to the P supply capacity of different soils under the regime of omitting P fertilization for rice, how to utilize the bioavailability of P in different P supply capacity soils when P fertilization is omitted for rice crops will be required in future work.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11368-014-1047-5.pdf,"@Article{Wang2015,

The diversity of the workforce including the importance of including women is noted. Importantly, these efforts are being undertaken on a global, regional, and national basis with an increasing level of inter-coordination. Addressed are the benefits of enhancing the effectiveness of current human resources in eye health (HReH), the growing array of training strategies and resources, and priorities for moving forward."",

The concentrations of total P and Olsen P were in the order FP < IP < HY < ISSM; the order for inorganic and organic P fractions obtained by chemical analysis was also the same except for Ca10-P that showed an opposite order. 31P NMR spectroscopy showed that inorganic orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, orthophosphate monoesters, and orthophosphate diesters were all higher in the surface soil in ISSM treatment than in HY, IP, and FP treatments.

Springer Link,Data Fabric and Data Mesh Use Case Scenarios,2022,0,"Eberhard Hechler,Maryela Weihrauch &Yan (Catherine) Wu","Apress, Berkeley, CA",Chapter,"Purpose
 One of the most significant problems in eutrophic lakes is the presence of algal blooms, which may affect phosphorus (P) inactivation agents (PIAs) in the control of P release from sediment. Therefore, in this study, lanthanum/aluminium co-modified thermally treated calcium-rich attapulgite (LA@TCAP) is used to analyse the influence and mechanisms of algal blooms on P inactivation effect to provide technical support for the application of PIAs.
 Materials and methods
 In August 2020, lake water, sediments, and algae were collected from Zhushan Bay in Lake Taihu and LA@TCAP was prepared in the laboratory. These samples were used to establish three groups of microscopic simulation experiments. Through sequential extraction and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance, the mobile forms of P (Mobile-P) of sediment in each experimental group were measured and analysed, and the influence of algal blooms on the inactivation effect of the P immobilisation of LA@TCAP was determined. Physical and chemical properties of overlying water (DO, pH, algae organic matter (AOM), etc) and microbial community structure of capping layers were used to understand the influence mechanisms of algal blooms on the inactivation effect of PIAs.
 Results and discussion
 The concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the overlying water was reduced due to the decomposition of algal blooms, which increased the relative abundance of P-solubilising bacteria, and transformed more inert forms of P (Inert-P) into Mobile-P in the capping layer. Simultaneously, the algal blooms released OP, which passed through the capping layer and increased the OP content in the sediment. Under this dual effect, the Mobile-P content in the sediment increased, making LA@TCAP unable to inactivate the increased mobile-P, which was bound to affect the inactivation effect of LA@TCAP. Besides, the AOM released from the algal blooms combined with the metal ions in LA@TCAP, resulting in the reduction of adsorption sites of LA@TCAP for P.
 Conclusions
 The algal blooms significantly decreased the DO concentration in the overlying water, thereby affecting the microbial community and transforming more Inert-P into Mobile-P. In addition, the adsorption performance of LA@TCAP for P also reduced owing to AOM competed with P for the metal ions in the LA@TCAP. Thus, algal blooms reduced the ability of LA@TCAP to control the P release from sediment.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-1-4842-9253-2.pdf,"@Inbook{Hechler2023,

Springer Link,Big Data Engineering,2022,0,Damian Tamburri &Willem-Jan van den Heuvel,"Springer, Cham",Chapter,"Purpose
 The objective of this study was to investigate the characteristics of sediment organic phosphorus (Po) driven by the microbial community during the ecological restoration of a plateau wetland.
 Materials and methods
 Twenty surface sediment samples were collected from the Caohai wetland, China. A series of analysis methods were used, including Ivanoff extraction, enzymatic hydrolysis, solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR), and high-throughput sequencing technology.
 Results
 The concentrations of the total Po were in the range 564.66 to 751.30 mg kgâˆ’1, among which Ful-Po was the dominant component with a proportion of 38.67â€“45.37%. In the enzymatically hydrolyzable Po, phosphomonoester was the main fraction accounting for 19.58â€“67.87%, while it made up 52.91â€“68.98% of the Po determined by 31P-NMR. The biogeochemical feature of Po indicated the high releasing risk of bioavailable Po from the sediment to the overlying water in the Caohai plateau wetland. Anthropogenic input was the dominant source of Po in the sediments, followed by the internal biological processes. Two thousand sixty-six OTUs were clustered in the phoD gene-harboring communities and were dominated by the Proteobacteria phylum and Rubrobacter genus. The redundancy analysis (RDA), correlation network analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM) suggested the direct and/or indirect (coupling the C and N cycles) contribution of phoD gene communities to P fractions.
 Conclusion
 This study established the influence of microbes on P fractions and provided a valuable understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of P in sediment from an ecologically restored wetland.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-19554-9.pdf,"@Inbook{Tamburri2023,

However, the effects of ISSM on the properties of soils are not yet clear. Based on a seven-year (2009â€“2016) field plot trial with continuous corn monoculture, this study compared the effects of ISSM with improved practice (IP), high-yield practice (HY), and current farming practice (FP) on phosphorus (P) forms in an Alluvic Primosol of Northeast China by using chemical and spectroscopic (31P NMR) analyses. The concentrations of total P and Olsen P were in the order FP < IP < HY < ISSM; the order for inorganic and organic P fractions obtained by chemical analysis was also the same except for Ca10-P that showed an opposite order. 31P NMR spectroscopy showed that inorganic orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, orthophosphate monoesters, and orthophosphate diesters were all higher in the surface soil in ISSM treatment than in HY, IP, and FP treatments.

This research paper represents a similar attempt by proposing iFlow, a software tool for the easy creation of cross-platform data flow pipelines based on the Python programming language. The tool leverages the default file system of the user's operating system, enabling faster and real-time inflow and outflow of data for easier and more convenient data processing. The project plan emphasizes modularity and extensibility, with a focus on the automation of data pipelines, as well as the development of associated UI components for a better user experience. The paper highlights the potential applications of iFlow in the field of machine learning pipelines, positioning it as a lightweight and open-source MLOps framework for the future.

abstract=""With the advent of ML applications cutting across sectors, data preprocessing for the training and proper functioning of ML models has seen a rise in importance. This research paper represents a similar attempt by proposing iFlow, a software tool for the easy creation of cross-platform data flow pipelines based on the Python programming language. The tool leverages the default file system of the user's operating system, enabling faster and real-time inflow and outflow of data for easier and more convenient data processing. The project plan emphasizes modularity and extensibility, with a focus on the automation of data pipelines, as well as the development of associated UI components for a better user experience. The paper highlights the potential applications of iFlow in the field of machine learning pipelines, positioning it as a lightweight and open-source MLOps framework for the future."",

The emergence of AIOps makes it possible to automatically detect the state, allocate the resources, warn and detect the anomaly of the system through some machine learning models. Given dynamic online workloads, the running state of a production microservice system is constantly in flux. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously train, encapsulate and deploy models based on the current system status, so that the AIOps model can dynamically adapt to the system environment. To address this problem, this paper proposes a model management pipeline framework for AIOps on microservice platforms, and implements a prototype system based on Kubernetes to verify the framework. The system consists of three components: model training, model packaging and model deploying. Parallelization and parameter search are introduced in the model training process to support rapid training of multiple models and automated model hyperparameter tuning. Rapid deployment of models is supported by the model packaging and deploying components. Experiments were performed to verify the prototype system, and the experimental results illustrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.

Springer Link,MXT: A New Variant of Pyramid Vision Transformer for Multi-label Chest X-ray Image Classification,2022,0,"Xiaoben Jiang,Yu Zhu,Gan Cai,Bingbing Zheng &Dawei Yang",,Article,"Nowadays, the global COVID-19 situation is still serious, and the new mutant virus Delta has already spread all over the world. The chest X-ray is one of the most common radiological examinations for screening catheters and diagnosis of many lung diseases, which plays an important role in assisting clinical diagnosis during the outbreak. This study considers the problem of multi-label catheters and thorax disease classification on chest X-ray images based on computer vision. Therefore, we propose a new variant of pyramid vision Transformer for multi-label chest X-ray image classification, named MXT, which can capture both short and long-range visual information through self-attention. Especially, downsampling spatial reduction attention can reduce the resource consumption of using Transformer. Meanwhile, multi-layer overlap patch (MLOP) embedding is used to tokenize images and dynamic position feed forward with zero paddings can encode position instead of adding a positional mask. Furthermore, class token Transformer block and multi-label attention (MLA) are utilized to offer more effective processing of multi-label classification. We evaluate our MXT on Chest X-ray14 dataset which has 14 disease pathologies and Catheter dataset containing 11 types of catheter placement. Each image is labeled one or more categories. Compared with some state-of-the-art baselines, our MXT can yield the highest mean AUC score of 83.0% on the Chest X-ray14 dataset and 94.6% on the Catheter dataset. According to the ablation study, we can obtain the following results: (1) The proposed MLOP embedding has a better performance than overlap patch (OP) embedding layer and non-overlap patch (N-OP) embedding layer that the mean AUC score is improved 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. (2) Our demonstrate dynamic position feed forward can replace the traditional position mask which can learn the position information, and the mean AUC increased by 0.6%. (3) The mean AUC score by the designed MLA is more 0.2% and 0.6% than using the class token and calculating the mean scores of all tokens. The comprehensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for multi-label chest X-ray image classification.

Organisations aim to minimise time to market of their products, which makes it relevant to identify how alignment issues affect time to market. Currently, empirical evidence of the effect of implementing alignment activities on delivering software is scarce. This research aims to identify those alignment activities that shorten the time to market of backlog items. First, examination of key concepts led to a grounded choice of alignment activities taken into account. Use of alignment activities in development of features was identified by sending feature owners a close-ended questionnaire on the alignment of their collaborating Scrum teams. The cycle times of backlog items were measured by using the application programmable interface of the agile tool used for tracking backlog items. Results show that when user stories were developed using a shared Definition of Ready, process and lead time decreased significantly. Process and lead time also differed between user stories implementing a different number of shared feedback sessions, where using two shared feedback sessions per sprint resulted in the lowest process and lead time.

In this paper we conduct a systematic literature review to provide an in-depth analysis of the success factors and the challenges of democratizing the artificial intelligence practices in the enterprises, we also build on this review and propose a framework for the enterprise AI democratization that suggests a set of the success factors and challenges. The research design of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review by including 41 papers as an initial set of studies for review; we screen the papers and implement inclusion and quality checks on these studies, and we qualify 15 papers for the final review. The key findings of this paper, from the systematic literature review, list a set of success factors and challenges that enterprises should consider to strengthen or to avoid. We propose these factors in a form of proposed framework suggesting four categories: strategy, enterprise architecture, data, and trust. Because of the publication specification and limitation, we limited the scope of our primary studies to a limited set to match the constraints and limitations. The paper includes implications for the academic literature review and the extraction of factors that can impact the process of the enterprise artificial intelligence democratization, and the need to increase the awareness of the enterprise AI practices in order to overcome the challenges that might prevent enterprises from having a successful enterprise AI. While there are some efforts to assess and review the success factors and challenges of the AI practices in general, one of the major findings of the literature review conducted is that there is evident research gap in the literature on the perception and associated factors of artificial intelligence. This paper seeks to fill this gap.

 &Juan Trujillo","Springer, Cham",Chapter and Conference Paper,"The performance of a Machine Learning (ML) model greatly depends on the previous preprocessing of the data. Unfortunately, the decision on which preprocessing techniques should be applied relies on the expertise of data scientists and/or ML practitioners. Since the correct application of some techniques depend on the characteristics of the data whereas others depend on the particular ML model to be trained, this leads to an error-prone process that requires the data scientist to be knowledgeable in all the combinations that may arise. To tackle this problem, we propose a methodology that guides the selection of the most appropriated preprocessing techniques that are highly required or strongly recommended taking into account both the ML model as well as the data characteristics, so that the developer is able to freely experiment with different models while ensuring that no needed preprocessing techniques are overlooked. According to the ML model and the data at hand, the methodology will (i) obtain the characteristics of the model (ii) check whether these characteristics are met by the data or not and (iii) show to the developer which variables require preprocessing and which techniques should be applied so that a proper decision can be made. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only work that tries to gather the most common ML models together with its most adequate preprocessing techniques and encode this information into a methodology that guides this process in a systematic way.

 ,Daohan Song &Li Jia",,Article,"In software development, issue tracker systems are widely used to manage bug reports. In such a system, a bug report can be filed, diagnosed, assigned, and fixed. In the standard process, a bug can be resolved as fixed, invalid, duplicated, or wonâ€™t fix. Although the above resolutions are well-defined and easy to understand, a bug report can end with a less -known resolution, i.e., a workaround. Compared with other resolutions, the definition of workarounds is more ambiguous. Besides the problem that is reported in a bug report, the resolution of a workaround raises more questions. Some questions are important for users, especially those programmers who build their projects upon others (e.g., libraries). Although some early studies have been conducted to analyze API workarounds, many research questions on workarounds are still open. For example, which bugs are resolved as workarounds? Why is a bug report resolved as a workaround? What are the repairs and impacts of workarounds? In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study to explore the above research questions. In particular, we analyzed 200 real workarounds that were collected from 81 Apache projects. Our results lead to eight findings and answers to all the above questions. For example, if bug reports are resolved as workarounds, their problems often either arise in external projects (40%) or reside in programming environments (23.5%). Although the problems of some workarounds (38.5%) reside in the project where they are reported, it is difficult to fix them fully and perfectly.

Springer Link,A novel botnet attack detection for IoT networks based on communication graphs,2022,0,"David Concejal MuÃ±oz
 &Antonio del-Corte Valiente",,Article,"Abstract
 Intrusion detection systems have been proposed for the detection of botnet attacks. Various types of centralized or distributed cloud-based machine learning and deep learning models have been suggested. However, the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought about a huge increase in connected devices, necessitating a different approach. In this paper, we propose to perform detection on IoT-edge devices. The suggested architecture includes an anomaly intrusion detection system in the application layer of IoT-edge devices, arranged in software-defined networks. IoT-edge devices request information from the software-defined networks controller about their own behaviour in the network. This behaviour is represented by communication graphs and is novel for IoT networks. This representation better characterizes the behaviour of the device than the traditional analysis of network traffic, with a lower volume of information. Botnet attack scenarios are simulated with the IoT-23 dataset. Experimental results show that attacks are detected with high accuracy using a deep learning model with low device memory requirements and significant storage reduction for training.

Springer Link,Multi-metric Approach for Decomposition of Microservice-Based Data Science Workflows,2022,0,"Christoph SchrÃ¶er
 ,Sven Wittfoth &Jorge Marx GÃ³mez","Springer, Cham",Chapter and Conference Paper,"To support fast development cycles in data science, microservice architectures are becoming increasingly important. However, while the design and identification of microservices in transaction-oriented applications are already widely studied, software architects lack support for data science workflows. The identification of microservices for data science workflows differs due to high volume and velocity characteristics.
 With this work, we aim to present a multi-metric approach for decomposition of microservice-based data science workflows. First, we select different metrics and evaluate their impact on workflow execution under different workload and data conditions. Within the approach, we provide a software architecture that enables microservice architectures to be deployed concurrently in cloud environments considering microservice design patterns such as orchestration of choreography. This architecture can be used to run real-world experiments, aggregate logs and analyze them in an automated way with respect to our chosen metrics. We evaluated our approach using a real-world data science workflow for automated startup assessments.
 Our work has both practical, theoretical and economic implications. Practically, it can support software architects and data scientists in architecting microservices. In this context, it also has implications for MLOps, as microservices can be used to train and deploy ML models. Theoretically, our software architecture can be used for other research comparing microservice architectures. Economically, we also achieve business impact by looking at the cost of microservice architectures based on service activation time.

Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) is a process for pattern discovery and predictive modeling in large databases. KDD encompasses and makes extensive use of data-mining methodsâ€”automated processes and algorithms that enable pattern recognition and classification. Characteristically, KDD involves the use of machine learning methods developed in the domain of artificial intelligence and information retrieval. These methods, which include both structure learning and parameter learning, have been applied to healthcare and biomedical data for various purposes with good success and potential or realized clinical translation. We introduce the Fayyad model of knowledge discovery in databases and describe the steps of the process, providing select examples from clinical research informatics. These steps range from initial data selection and preparation to interpretation and evaluation. Commonly used data-mining methods are surveyed: artificial neural networks, decision-tree induction, support vector machines (kernel methods), association-rule induction, k-nearest neighbor, and probabilistic methods such as Bayesian networks. We link methods for evaluating the models that result from the KDD process to methods used in diagnostic medicine, spotlighting measures derived from a confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and, more recently, uncertainty quantification and conformal prediction. Throughout the chapter, we discuss salient aspects of biomedical data management and use, including applications, the use of FAIR principles, pipelines and infrastructure for KDD, and future directions.

Biquality Learning assumes that two datasets are available at training time: a trusted dataset sampled from the distribution of interest and the untrusted dataset with dataset shifts and weaknesses of supervision (aka distribution shifts). The trusted and untrusted datasets available at training time make designing algorithms dealing with any distribution shifts possible. We propose two methods, one inspired by the label noise literature and another by the covariate shift literature for biquality learning.

The work addresses several challenges: prioritizing data to reduce movement, tracking lineage to optimize complex ML pipelines, and enabling reproducibility and portability of data selection and ML model development. Off-the-shelf AI metadata management frameworks (such as MLflow or Weights & Biases) focus on fine-grain stage-level metadata, and only track parts of the pipeline, and lineage. Our proposed software layer sits between ML workflows and pipelines and storage/data access. The first implementation of the Data Foundation is the Common Metadata Framework (CMF), which captures metadata and tracks them automatically alongside references to data artifacts and application code. Its git-like nature allows parallel model development by different teams and is well suited for federated environments. It includes intelligence to optimize pipelines and storage, can learn the access patterns from pipeline execution to inform optimizations such as prestaging and caching. It also learns from model inference metrics to build iteratively more robust models. Through a data shaping use case for I/O optimization and an active learning use case to reduce labelling (on DeepCam AI model training on climate data running on NERSC Cori), we show the versatility of the data foundation layer, the potential benefits (4x reduction in training time and 2x reduction in labelling effort), and its central role in complex ML pipelines.

Moreover, the design of AI-based critical systems, such as in avionics, mobility, defense, healthcare, finance, critical infrastructures, etc., requires proving their trustworthiness. Thus, AI-based critical systems must be assessed across many dimensions by different parties (regulators, developers, customers, reinsurance companies, and end-users) for different reasons. We can call it AI validation, monitoring, assessing, or auditing, but the fundamental concept in all cases is to make sure that the AI is performing well within its operational design domain. Such assessment begins from the early stages of development, including the definition of the specification requirements for the system, the analysis, the design, etc. Trust and trustworthiness assessment have to be considered at every phase of the system lifecycle, including sale and deployment, updates, maintenance, or int. It is expected that full trustworthiness in AI systems can only be established if the technical measures to establish trustworthiness are flanked by specifications for the governance and processes of organizations that use and develop AI. Application of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) methods and principles to handle humanâ€“AI interaction, and aid in the operationalisation of (ethical) values in the design and assessment, with important information provided on their actual impact on trust and trustworthiness is a key issue.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s43681-023-00397-z.pdf,"@Article{Braunschweig2024,

Obviously, while highlighting the robustness of the public cloud, the pandemic-induced situation also highlights several important research challenges that need to be addressed.
 This paper presents a multi-source based analysis for the identification of cloud computing research challenges as part of the road mapping methodology followed in the HUB4CLOUD project. The analysis consists of an in-depth study of several sources including analysis of the international context, analysis of academic venues, interviews with relevant stakeholders and existing funded projects.
 The paper also provides an overview of the main research topics identified and proposes next steps for the utilization of these finding in the development of a Cloud Computing research roadmap.

Springer Link,Editorial,2022,0,"Ralf Krestel,Udo Kruschwitz,Michael Wiegand &Theo HÃ¤rder",,,"Social media has many benefits: from staying in contact with close and not-so-close friends, over exercising the right to voice oneâ€™s opinion, to communicating with many like-minded people all over the world and providing an additional channel for information exchange.
 Unfortunately, social media has also been abused and misused ever since its inception. Hate speech is prevalent on many sites alienating trusting users and hindering fruitful discussions. Fake news are distributed through social media platforms with dangerous effects. But even without malicious intention, social media can be misleading due to various biases in the system.
 In this special issue of Datenbank-Spektrum, we will explore and present current trends in the field of automatically detecting and managing hate speech, fake news, bias and other toxic content in the context of social media. We solicited novel research contributions and received eight submissions in total. Each submission was reviewed by two independent reviewers and then discussed among the editors. Four papers were finally accepted covering a broad range of topics.
 The first article entitled Automated multilingual detection of Pro-Kremlin propaganda in newspapers and Telegram posts by Veronika Solopova, Oana-Juliana Popescu, Christoph BenzmÃ¼ller and Tim Landgraf explores the specific natural language processing problem of propaganda detection and looks at it both with a quantitative as well as a qualitative angle. Transformer-based and linguistically motivated approaches are investigated and compared. This leads to some surprising findings including the use of some seemingly neutral lexical items that turn out to be strong indicators of propaganda in this context. The authors hope to make a contribution towards understanding patterns of fake news or propaganda detection and in particular offering some steps towards addressing the problem in less resourced languages.
 The next contribution, Generalizability of Abusive Language Detection Models on Homogeneous German Datasets by Nina Seemann, Yeong Su Lee, Julian HÃ¶llig and Michaela Geierhos compares the compatibility of different German datasets for abusive language detection from the GermEval and HASOC evaluation campaigns. The authors find that a combination of different datasets is not always beneficial. Its effectiveness not only depends on the similarity of annotation schemes but also on the source from which the respective text samples have been drawn. The authors take into consideration different types of learning methods. An error analysis of the output of the strongest classifier provides more insights into the properties of the different datasets.
 The third article Moving Beyond Benchmarks and Competitions: Towards Addressing Social Media Challenges in an Educational Context by Dimitri Ognibene, Gregor Donabauer, Emily Theophilou, Sathya Bursic, Francesco Lomonaco, Rodrigo Wilkens, Davinia Hernandez-Leo, and Udo Kruschwitz emphasizes the importance of not just chasing state-of-the-art performance measures when tackling fake news, filter bubbles, or cyberbullying. Instead they argue that such social media threats should be addressed by educating users with a focus on teenagers. Hence, the efforts developed as part of the COURAGE project are twofold: building multi-modal threat detectors and content analyzers on the one hand and educating users in dealing with social media threats and the output of machine learning methods active on social media sites.
 The final article of this special issue Avoiding Bias when Capturing Illegal Hate Speech by Johannes SchÃ¤fer exemplifies the creation of a dataset sampled from Twitter for hate speech detection with a fine-grained class inventory bearing in mind the definitions of German law code (â€œStrafgesetzbuch (StGB)â€). The annotation scheme distinguishes between 4 subclasses of hate speech: malicious gossip/defamation, incitement to commit offenses, incitement of masses, and insults. In their classification experiments, the authors also focus on the role of identity terms. While such terms are often biased towards specific classes (â€œidentity term biasâ€), the authors also argue that the removal of such terms, which can be regarded as â€œbrute-forceâ€ bias mitigation, omits essential information for a classifier to make a correct prediction.

In this paper, we explore and employ deep learning methods such as RNN, LSTM and GRU to detect the Atrial Fibrillation (AF) faster in the given electrocardiogram traces. For this study, we used one of the well-known publicly available MIT-BIH Physionet dataset. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time Deep learning has been employed to detect the Atrial Fibrillation in real-time.

The most important ROS include superoxide (O2.âˆ’), perhydroxy radical (HO2.), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxy radical (OH.), and singlet oxygen (âˆ£O2). The other secondary oxidative products like alkoxy radical (RO.), peroxy radical (ROO.), organic hydroperoxide (ROOH), excited carbonyl (RO.), etc. are also produced in plant cells.

Lipid peroxidation, which is known to produce ROS like alkoxy, peroxy radicals as well as singlet oxygen, is also considered as bona fide source of ROS in plant cells. In plants, apoplastic enzyme respiratory burst oxidase homologs (RBOHs) or NADPH oxidases play a major role in originating ROS wave through the other network of ROS production as well.

However, an elaborate and efficient antioxidative defense system, comprising a variety of antioxidant molecules, quenchers, and enzymes, determines the ROS turnover and hence the steady-state level of ROS and the redox status of the cell. Plants are equipped with those defense systems not only to combat enhanced level of ROS but also to tightly regulate the endogenous concentration necessary for controlling various events of Plant Biology. However, the decontrolled level of ROS generation, if remaining unabated may cause a solemn threat to or cause oxidative deterioration and in extreme cases the death of plant cells. The present chapter describes the physicochemical basis of the production of ROS, under normal and unfavorable environmental conditions, and senescence, with an added effort to understand their implication associated with those situations.

 Digital interventions are typically evaluated by their effectiveness and engagement, while the characteristics of patients who perceive them to be attractive have remained poorly understood. This challenges user-centered intervention development but also presents an avenue to improve intervention efficacy and engagement. Our objective was to characterize people to whom game-based interventions appeal to with a focus on their mental health backgrounds and prior digital game experiences.
 Methods
 We performed a sequential mixed methods study with adults suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) who participated in a randomized controlled clinical trial studying the effectiveness of a game-based digital intervention for depression. First, randomly chosen participants were interviewed (Nâ€‰=â€‰22), and the transcribed data were analyzed inductively. Then, focusing on the themes established through the interview data, we triangulated the findings using complementary questionnaire data (Nâ€‰=â€‰445).
 Results
 The interview data yielded four themes that we illuminated with quantified questionnaire data. (T1) The participants had enduring and diverse psychiatric symptomology: 73% had been diagnosed with a comorbid disorder in addition to depression. (T2) Participants had received at least some treatments that had not led to full remission of depression. 92% currently received therapeutic support, psychiatric medication, or both. (T3) Many participants had close relationships with digital gaming and played actively: on average, for 13 h a week on various gaming platforms and in various genres. (T4) Some participants used gaming to manage their psychiatric symptoms, and 76% found that playing helped them feel better.
 Conclusions
 Identifying and characterizing people attracted to game-based therapeutic interventions can catalyze intervention development and improve their efficacy. We found that game-based interventions have appealing potential across diverse psychiatric symptoms and for people with prior or existing treatments. Game-based interventions may appeal particularly to active players and offer a promising alternative to the self-treatment usage of entertainment games.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s44247-023-00037-w.pdf,"@Article{Lukka2023,

 ,Ming Kong,Shucong Lv &Liangjing Zhang",,Article,"Purpose
 This study developed a modified oxygen nano-bubble lanthanum-aluminum attapulgite (OLA) for increasing oxygen and inhibiting phosphorus (P) release from heavily polluted sediment.
 Materials and methods
 The OLA material was prepared. The vertical sediment columns were divided into three groups for incubation experiment, namely, OLA capping, LA capping group, and uncapping group. The feasibility of OLA applied as a capping material to regulate redox condition at the sedimentâ€’water interface (SWI) and to reduce the sediment P release was assessed by comprehensively analyzing the oxygen penetration depth and time. The changes of dissolved and labile P and Fe in pore water and sediment were measured using DGTs and HR-Peepers. Variations of inorganic and organic P (IP and OP) and the microbial diversity in sediment were investigated during the incubation period.
 Results and discussion
 OLA can rapidly increase the dissolved oxygen (DO), which significantly alleviate the anoxic environment of SWI. The largest DO penetration depth reached 22.5 mm and maintained a high concentration for 48h. The presence of oxygen changed the abundance of microorganisms on the sediment surface, with a decrease in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria and an increase of Chloroflexi. This resulted in the acceleration of the conversion of organic P (OP) to dissolved P. Also, a part of OP and mobile P oxidized into non-labile OP. It is worth noting that Fe(II) and S(-II) showed positive correlation at the depth of 0â€“40 mm. This may be due to the reduction of sulfate generating FeS, which decouples Fe and P.
 Conclusions
 OLA capping is a promising method for controlling the internal P release from sediments and has the potential for emergency P remediation management from black odorous rivers.",,"@Article{Wang2024,

 From a software architecture perspective, it is still a challenge to design systems for edge analytics as it raises many architecture-related questions. However, this architectural perspective on edge analytics has not been consolidated in literature so far. Therefore, in this paper, we first give an overview of the edge analytics topic from the perspective of our own experience from industrial projects, before we survey a subset of existing approaches for edge analytics and review them from a software architecture point of view. We investigate the differences among the surveyed architectures in order to shed some light on the covered architectural aspects of edge analytics architectures, which will be useful for future academic and industrial projects incorporating edge analytics.

Additionally, we implemented mechanisms to capture automatically auditable traces of the system to ensure the transparency of the processes. Our quantitative evaluation showed overall promising results, while the in-depth qualitative analysis revealed concrete error types, providing guidance on how to improve the current prototype.

abstract=""Based on a real world use case, we developed and evaluated a hybrid AI system that aims to extract key elements from legal permits by combining methods from the Semantic Web and Machine Learning. Specifically, we modelled the available background knowledge in a custom Knowledge Graph, which we exploited together with the usage of different language- and text-embedding-models in order to extract different information from official Austrian permits, including the Issuing Authority, the Operator of the facility in question, the Reference Number, and the Issuing Date. Additionally, we implemented mechanisms to capture automatically auditable traces of the system to ensure the transparency of the processes. Our quantitative evaluation showed overall promising results, while the in-depth qualitative analysis revealed concrete error types, providing guidance on how to improve the current prototype."",

However, their performance degrades rapidly on tougher tasks where images are of low resolution or objects are small. In this paper, we point out that this roots in a defective yet common design in existing CNN architectures, namely the use of strided convolution and/or pooling layers, which results in a loss of fine-grained information and learning of less effective feature representations. To this end, we propose a new CNN building block called SPD-Conv in place of each strided convolution layer and each pooling layer (thus eliminates them altogether). SPD-Conv is comprised of a space-to-depth (SPD) layer followed by a non-strided convolution (Conv) layer, and can be applied in most if not all CNN architectures. We explain this new design under two most representative computer vision tasks: object detection and image classification. We then create new CNN architectures by applying SPD-Conv to YOLOv5 and ResNet, and empirically show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models, especially on tougher tasks with low-resolution images and small objects.

Springer Link,A Framework for Building pro-bono Data for Good Projects,2021,#VALUE!,Miguel JosÃ© Monteiro &Paulo Maia,"Springer, Cham",Chapter and Conference Paper,"Initiatives relying on data science for social good - non-commercial projects that deliver socially beneficial outcomes - have been on the rise in the last years. The area of Data for Good has several specific challenges, one of which is the definition of a formal framework for the design, conception, prioritization, development and impact measurement of such applications. All over the world, volunteers are organized in local/regional initiatives that provide voluntary support to social good organizations in the development of Data for Good projects. Each of these initiatives follows specific internal frameworks that are not standardized within the community, with information-sharing efforts just starting to appear.

abstract=""Initiatives relying on data science for social good - non-commercial projects that deliver socially beneficial outcomes - have been on the rise in the last years. The area of Data for Good has several specific challenges, one of which is the definition of a formal framework for the design, conception, prioritization, development and impact measurement of such applications. All over the world, volunteers are organized in local/regional initiatives that provide voluntary support to social good organizations in the development of Data for Good projects. Each of these initiatives follows specific internal frameworks that are not standardized within the community, with information-sharing efforts just starting to appear. Sharing these frameworks could lead to an increase in the amount of successful data for good projects, delivering concrete value in the daily operations of social good institutions. In this paper, the framework that was created and is being followed with success at Data Science for Social Good Portugal (DSSG PT), an open community of data enthusiasts working pro-bono in Data for Good projects, is shared.

Springer Link,Governing Artificial Intelligence in Post-Pandemic Society,2021,0,Aravindhan Arunagiri &Avadhanam Udayaadithya,"Springer, Singapore",Chapter,"Pandemic escalated the need of adopting technology for human security and public service. Technological integration and digital transformation are of focus in the strategy to recover and reconstruct civic society post-pandemic across the globe, especially in the domains of healthcare, education, surveillance, and governance. Artificial intelligence (AI) is seen to benefit society through building and assisting critical socio-technical systems.
 Automated decision-making through algorithms is debated widely for its limitations in tackling biases and inability to discourage unintended. Moreover, AI learns patterns from the data, which by nature is biased due to existing socio-economic complexities. The pervasive application of AI when implemented and integrated with social systems is observed to pose socio-ethical challenges such as institutionalization of discrimination, biased decision-making, intrusiveness, low accountability, and mistrust. Various threats and vulnerabilities imposed to human community-like natural disasters, health pandemics, and economic uncertainties necessitate inevitable adoption of AI applications that can mitigate socio-ethical challenges and adhere to human security principles. Current data protection laws seem to be insufficient to protect human rights in the given scenarios.
 Literature advocates for transparency, explainability, and auditability of AI models. However, it may not necessarily lead to accountability and fairness. Embedding these socio-technical systems in the broader institutional frameworks of regulation and governance can balance the risks without compromising on the benefits of technological innovations. The socio-economic context in which AI model is deployed necessitates the responses to be local and context specific. This also necessitates AI governance framework to be comprehensive, prevention-oriented, while protecting and empowering human value and dignity.
 This chapter provides commentary on the social, ethical, and technical issues that AI can impose along with various aspects that need to be considered while governing AI. Finally, an AI governance framework is proposed based on socio-administrative principles to extend their credibility in mitigating, managing and governing the human threats and uphold human security.

In the context of an international research project, we develop an AI-based software platform that shall facilitate the collaboration between human operators and manufacturing machines.
 We conducted 14 structured interviews with stakeholders of the prospective software platform in order to determine the individual relevance of selected quality characteristics for human-AI teaming in smart manufacturing. These characteristics include the ISO 25010:2011 standard for software quality and AI-specific quality characteristics such as trustworthiness, explicability, and auditability. The interviewees rated trustworthiness, functional suitability, reliability, and security as the most important quality characteristics for this context, and portability, compatibility, and maintainability as the least important. Also, we observed agreement regarding the relevance of the quality characteristics among interviewees having the same role. On the other hand, the relevance of each quality characteristics varied depending on the concrete use case of the prospective software platform.
 The interviewees also were asked about the key success factors related to human-AI teaming in smart manufacturing. They identified improving the production cycle, increasing operator efficiency, reducing scrap, and reducing ergonomic risks as key success criteria. In this paper, we also discuss metrics for measuring the fulfillment of these quality characteristics, which we intend to operationalize and monitor during operation of the prospective software platform.

It thereby enables re-utilization of concepts and software, prevents reinventing the wheel and facilitates collaboration scenarios. AI2VIS4BigData was systematically derived from two foundation reference models utilizing reasoned assumptions. These assumptions required subjective decisions which were not evaluated right away. This publication targets to change that through presenting two qualitative evaluation approaches that were conducted in the course of an official satellite workshop of an international conference. Selected scientific and industrial experts participated thereby in an expert round table workshop and a survey. The validation results confirm the reference modelâ€™s practical applicability and legitimate the substantial majority of subjective decisions that were taken in the course of the reference model derivation.

abstract=""AI2VIS4BigData is a reference model for Artificial Intelligence (AI) - based Big Data Analysis and Visualization that provides uniform terminology and logical entity-relationships to scientists and professionals working in this application domain. It thereby enables re-utilization of concepts and software, prevents reinventing the wheel and facilitates collaboration scenarios. AI2VIS4BigData was systematically derived from two foundation reference models utilizing reasoned assumptions. These assumptions required subjective decisions which were not evaluated right away. This publication targets to change that through presenting two qualitative evaluation approaches that were conducted in the course of an official satellite workshop of an international conference. Selected scientific and industrial experts participated thereby in an expert round table workshop and a survey. The validation results confirm the reference model's practical applicability and legitimate the substantial majority of subjective decisions that were taken in the course of the reference model derivation. This publication concludes with outlining five research fields for future work that comprise the non-validated subjective decisions."",

The clay fraction of loess, also known as â€˜loessial clayâ€™, is a very important component of loess which affects its properties and performance. From a â€˜materialsâ€™ perspective, the clay fraction of loess has been ignored. Recently, loess particles have attracted interest because of their potential applications. The focus in the current review is on the methods of modifying loess particles and their application as functional materials. The major components of loess particles are clays, calcite, and quartz, with the clays including kaolinite, illite, montmorillonite, and chlorite. Loess has a range of particle sizes, types, and dispersibilities. The particles agglomerate readily, mainly because cementation occurs readily in the clay fraction. Loess particles can be modified and their properties can be improved by compaction, separation, purification, acidification, calcination, surfactant modification, geopolymerization, and polymer modification. Loess-based functional materials have been used as sorbents, eco-friendly superabsorbents, soil and water conservation materials, humidity-regulating materials, and building materials.

However, the inductive and experimental nature of ML exposes it to specific risks. If the latter are not controlled, ML has the potential to wreak havoc by impacting people and the environment. In that context, Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) is an approach used to measure a companyâ€™s sustainable behavior along those three dimensions. To develop responsible behavior, an organization should employ an ESG framework within its structure. In this paper, we propose a risk-based approach which aims to produce safe ML lifecycles. Its objective is to smoothly implement the ESG strategy throughout the ML process by identifying and mitigating risks.

 ,Philippe Tamla
 &Matthias Hemmje","Springer, Cham",Chapter and Conference Paper,"This paper presents a system for managing Cloud Resources such as memory and CPU/GPU that is used to develop, train, and customize Deep Learning-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) models in domains like heath care. The increasing digitization of healthcare services has led to the emergence of electronic health records (EHRs) as a significant component of healthcare data management. NER is a machine learning technique that can be applied to EHRs to extract information such as drug and treatment information, helping to support clinical decision making. The paper is addressing the difficulty domain experts face in using Cloud technologies to perform NER tasks, since they often require technical expertise and technical management overhead. The paper presents a system for the configuration of cloud resources for NER training using the spaCy framework and AWS compute services. The research is structured using Nunamakerâ€™s methodology, which provides a structured approach to software development through four phases: observation, theory building, systems development, and experimentation. The paper identifies problem statements and research questions to guide the research and maps them to the objectives of the methodology. The objectives of the methodology include researching the state-of-the-art of NER and cloud technologies, analyzing the architecture of motivating research projects, defining user requirements and the system architecture, and implementing the system. The system is designed using User Centered Systems Design and is based on previously identified user requirements. Two main user groups are considered for the application: NER Experts and Medical Domain Experts. The system is implemented using the Model-View-Controller architecture pattern. It allows for the training of Transformer models, selection of compute resources, and adjusting training configuration and hyperparameters. The system is designed for scalability of compute and storage resources. The paper also discusses the evaluation of the system through experiments and analysis of the results to gain insights. It provides information about the technical implementation and details about the user interface. It is evaluated using cognitive walkthrough and experiments with Transformer-based models.

abstract=""This paper presents a system for managing Cloud Resources such as memory and CPU/GPU that is used to develop, train, and customize Deep Learning-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) models in domains like heath care. The increasing digitization of healthcare services has led to the emergence of electronic health records (EHRs) as a significant component of healthcare data management. NER is a machine learning technique that can be applied to EHRs to extract information such as drug and treatment information, helping to support clinical decision making. The paper is addressing the difficulty domain experts face in using Cloud technologies to perform NER tasks, since they often require technical expertise and technical management overhead. The paper presents a system for the configuration of cloud resources for NER training using the spaCy framework and AWS compute services. The research is structured using Nunamaker's methodology, which provides a structured approach to software development through four phases: observation, theory building, systems development, and experimentation. The paper identifies problem statements and research questions to guide the research and maps them to the objectives of the methodology. The objectives of the methodology include researching the state-of-the-art of NER and cloud technologies, analyzing the architecture of motivating research projects, defining user requirements and the system architecture, and implementing the system. The system is designed using User Centered Systems Design and is based on previously identified user requirements. Two main user groups are considered for the application: NER Experts and Medical Domain Experts. The system is implemented using the Model-View-Controller architecture pattern. It allows for the training of Transformer models, selection of compute resources, and adjusting training configuration and hyperparameters. The system is designed for scalability of compute and storage resources. The paper also discusses the evaluation of the system through experiments and analysis of the results to gain insights. It provides information about the technical implementation and details about the user interface. It is evaluated using cognitive walkthrough and experiments with Transformer-based models."",

 &Sergii Stirenko","Springer, Singapore",Chapter and Conference Paper,"The problem of application of deep neural networks (DNNs) for extremely small dataset is considered to find the effect of dataset size and quality on performance metrics. Classification task is considered for the set of problems where images of Lyme disease symptoms were collected and structured in the open-access dataset with the different subsets of the whole dataset: clean images only (C), dirty images only (D), and clean and dirty images in the equal proportions (C_D) (https://www.kaggle.com/yoctoman/lyme-clean-and-dirty) . Two different data preprocessing techniques were applied: normalization without data augmentation (NODA) and normalization with data augmentation (DA). The two versions of the modern NASNet DNN architectures of different sizes were used, namely NASNetLarge and NASNetMobile, with the weights obtained after training on ImageNet dataset. These DNNs were trained in two experiments, namely with frozen layers, aka transfer learning (TL), and with unfrozen layers when all weights were updated (NOTL). After fivefold cross-validated training the best results for mean validation metrics were demonstrated by the models trained in C_NOTL_NODA, C_NOTL_DA, and C_TL_NODA experiments for NASNetLarge, and in C_TL_NODA by NASNetMobile. But the testing on the new unknown subset of Lyme disease images with the equal proportion of clean and dirty images gave quite different results. The models trained in the before-mentioned experiments demonstrated poor performance in comparison with the models trained in C_NOTL_DA, D_NOTL_DA experiments, and, especially in D_C_NOTL_DA ones. The successful training strategy should include tuning ImageNet-trained weights without their freezing (NOTL) and intensive data augmentation (DA), but it would not be enough if some diverse relevant background will not be added. That is why the additional methods of â€œcontext-relevant data augmentationâ€ (CRDA) mimicked by inclusion of D_C data configuration should be considered. These findings can be used for the more effective selection of training experiments of DNNs in the healthcare context in the view of the small number of available medical data in practice.

That is why the additional methods of ``context-relevant data augmentation'' (CRDA) mimicked by inclusion of D{\_}C data configuration should be considered. These findings can be used for the more effective selection of training experiments of DNNs in the healthcare context in the view of the small number of available medical data in practice."",

 &Korinn S. Ostrow","Springer, Cham",Chapter and Conference Paper,"The passage of the No Child Left Behind Act has increased an emphasis on developing K-12 curricula around existing and emergent state and national standards. The ever-growing volume of readily available K-12 digital content has increased the need for aligning learning and assessment content to relevant educational standards at scale. However, manual alignment is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Inspired by prior works on automated content alignment systems that leveraged recent advances in deep learning and NLP, this study explores a scalable solution for automatically aligning assessment items to multiple state and national standards. Results indicate the Transformer encoder-decoder model trained from scratch shows decent performance, reaching 34.3 BLEU score and 0.4 averaged ROUGE score on a holdout set. To investigate the limitation of the conventional evaluation metrics and gain deeper insights into the many-to-many relationships observed in the data, a series of metrics are utilized to evaluate the matches between the source and target sequences. In-depth error analysis identifies major error categories and explains the discrepancies in performances observed between the training and test set. Finally, this study discusses the potential for a production-level system and the future direction in extending the current approach to facilitate the development of a general skill taxonomy as a â€œcrosswalkâ€ for mapping educational content to standards.

To determine best practice, I have reviewed industry papers, standards, and comments of implementers. A systematic review of key reports on DevOps was conducted. Surveys conducted by a number of organizations with over 277,000 respondents are considered here. Key questions posed are how is DevOps perceived by industry, what are the key benefits from an industrial perspective, and what practices contribute to success. Results of this analysis show that while commonly accepted commercial reports make interesting reading; they are not sufficient to base critical decision in highly regulated industry. Furthermore, standards are required to establish confidence in process and product. This paper provides insights and guidance for software and systems development with DevOps practices in a highly regulated environment. I present the need for consistent quality to be encapsulated through industry standards.

The goal of our project is to support agroecology in terms of carbon farming and biodiversity protection by providing an AI and data streaming platform called Gaia-AgStream that accelerates the adoption of AI in agriculture and is directly usable by farmers as well as agricultural companies in general. The technical innovations we propose focus on smart sensor networks, unified uncertainty management, explainable AI, root cause analysis and hybrid AI approaches. Our AI and data streaming platform concept contributes to the European open data infrastructure project Gaia-X in terms of interoperability for data and AI models as well as data sovereignty and AI infrastructure.
 Our envisioned platform and the developed AI components for carbon farming and biodiversity will enable farmers to adopt sustainable and resilient production methods while establishing new and diverse revenue streams by monetizing carbon sequestration and AI ready data streams. The open and federated platform concept allows to bring together research, industry, agricultural start-ups and farmers in order to form sustainable innovation networks. We describe core concepts and architecture of our proposed approach in these contexts, outline practical use cases for our platform and finally outline challenges and future prospects.

Springer Link,Implementation and Evaluation of a MLaaS for Document Classification with Continuous Deep Learning Models,2023,0,Franz Frederik Walter Viktor Walter-Tscharf,"Springer, Cham",Chapter and Conference Paper,"This paper indicates an approach of a continuous training pipeline to enhance deep learning models and assessing their feasibility based on an evaluation. The purpose of this research is to analyze the quality effect of a continuously learning neural network algorithm for document classification by taking user feedback into account. The hypothesis implies that user feedback through active learning increases the precision and thus makes the process of document classification more efficient. For this purpose, based on a utility analysis, the available technologies are identified, and necessary ones are selected for designing a software concept. TensorFlow as a deep learning framework, Tesseract as an OCR engine, and Apache Airflow for the life cycle management and for orchestrating the elements for the continuous training pipeline are used. This implementation of a machine learning as a service prototype allows for exploration into the synergistic effect between the use of active learning, in the form of user feedback, and the quality of document classification achieved by deep learning. In an experiment, the implemented service is used to analyze the models behavior based on three different states. This includes synthetic data and active learning in the form of user feedback through data from data augmentation and simulated realistic data. The result shows that active learning enhanced models indicate a higher accuracy than artificially generated models. The evaluation experiment confirms the hypothesis that user feedback with continuously learning models perform better in terms of generalizing within the document classification. In conclusion, the paper demonstrates the technical requirements for implementing a machine learning as a service and affirms that the use of active learning can be integrated into existing industrial systems.

Since TinyML delivers AI capabilities to embedded devices, it is also known as edge AI or embedded AI.
 TinyML allows bringing AI to devices like smartphones, tablets et al., too. Since these mobile devices have currently surpassed desktop computers as the primary computing device for most users, it allows the possibility to engage even more end-users in crowdsourcing data for the IoT world.
 In this chapter, we will review the current status of TinyML by illustrating its underlying technologies and methodologies and showing some relevant examples where this new area is being used to provide novel applications, thanks to crowdsourcing as a way to engage the final user.

To survive in such an environment, companies must be able to quickly discover product ideas that meet the needs of both customers and the company and deliver these products to customers. Dual-track agile is a new type of agile development that combines product discovery and delivery activities in parallel, iterative, and cyclical ways. At present, many companies have difficulties in finding and establishing suitable approaches for implementing dual-track agile in their business context. Objective: In order to gain a better understanding of how product discovery and product delivery can interact with each other and how this interaction can be implemented in practice, this paper aims to identify suitable approaches to dual-track agile. Method: We conducted a grey literature review (GLR) according to the guidelines to Garousi et al. Results: Several approaches that support the integration of product discovery with product delivery were identified. This paper presents a selection of these approaches, i.e., the Discovery-Delivery Cycle model, Now-Next-Later Product Roadmaps, Lean Sprints, Product Kata, and Dual-Track Scrum. The approaches differ in their granularity but are similar in their underlying rationales. All approaches aim to ensure that only validated ideas turn into products and thus promise to lead to products that are better received by their users.

 ,Samir Malakar
 &Ram Sarkar",,Article,"Existing Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) systems tend to be expensive and rigid in their operation, often resulting in erroneous evaluations due to strict correction protocols. This scenario airs the need for a flexible OMR system. Hence, in this work, we propose a lightweight transfer learning based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, dubbed as OMRNet, which can classify answer boxes on any generalized OMR test sheet. Unlike most existing techniques that rely on image processing algorithms to recognize extracted answer boxes in two classes: confirmed and empty, the OMRNet is designed to classify the answer boxes into confirmed, crossed-out, and empty categories. That is, OMRNet is facilitating the crossing out of previously answered questions and thus removing the rigidity of templates in Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) tests. We have built OMRNet on top of a MobileNetV2 backbone connected to four fully connected layers with appropriate dropouts and activation functions in between. We have evaluated OMRNet on the Multiple Choice Answer Boxes dataset available at https://sites.google.com/view/mcq-dataset. We have performed experiments following a 5 fold cross validation scheme, and OMRNet has achieved accuracies of 95.29%, 95.88%, 93.97%, 97.45%, and 97.20%, with an average accuracy of 95.96%. Also, the experimental results confirm that the present model performs better than the compared state-of-the-art methods and standard CNN models in terms of accuracy, execution time, and memory required to store the trained module. Moreover, we have employed a quantization technique to make the trained module more memory efficient and deployed it to a web app using our own Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API).

abstract=""Existing Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) systems tend to be expensive and rigid in their operation, often resulting in erroneous evaluations due to strict correction protocols. This scenario airs the need for a flexible OMR system. Hence, in this work, we propose a lightweight transfer learning based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, dubbed as OMRNet, which can classify answer boxes on any generalized OMR test sheet. Unlike most existing techniques that rely on image processing algorithms to recognize extracted answer boxes in two classes: confirmed and empty, the OMRNet is designed to classify the answer boxes into confirmed, crossed-out, and empty categories. That is, OMRNet is facilitating the crossing out of previously answered questions and thus removing the rigidity of templates in Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) tests. We have built OMRNet on top of a MobileNetV2 backbone connected to four fully connected layers with appropriate dropouts and activation functions in between. We have evaluated OMRNet on the Multiple Choice Answer Boxes dataset available at https://sites.google.com/view/mcq-dataset. We have performed experiments following a 5 fold cross validation scheme, and OMRNet has achieved accuracies of 95.29{\%}, 95.88{\%}, 93.97{\%}, 97.45{\%}, and 97.20{\%}, with an average accuracy of 95.96{\%}. Also, the experimental results confirm that the present model performs better than the compared state-of-the-art methods and standard CNN models in terms of accuracy, execution time, and memory required to store the trained module. Moreover, we have employed a quantization technique to make the trained module more memory efficient and deployed it to a web app using our own Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API). It makes OMRNet available via a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) endpoint, allowing potential users to connect to it via the Internet.

 Hsa-miR-548ba expressed in ovarian granulosa cells targets PTEN and LIFR, which are essential for ovarian follicle activation and growth. The expression pattern of hsa-miR-548ba correlates with its host gene follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), and FSH has a positive influence on hsa-miR-548ba expression. However, hsa-miR-548ba is a member of a large hsa-mir-548 family with potentially overlapping targets. The current study aims to investigate the co-expression of hsa-mir-548 family members in FSHR-positive reproductive tissues and to explore the potential co-regulation of pathways.
 Results
 For the above-described analysis, small RNA sequencing data from public data repositories were used. Sequencing results revealed that hsa-miR-548ba was expressed at the highest level in the ovarian granulosa cells and uterine myometrial samples together with another twelve and one hsa-miR-548 family members, respectively. Pathway enrichment analysis of microRNA targets in the ovarian samples revealed the hsa-miR-548ba and hsa-miR-548b-5p co-regulation of RAB geranylgeranylation in mural granulosa cells. Moreover, other hsa-mir-548 family members co-regulate pathways essential for ovarian functions (PIP3 activates AKT signalling and signalling by ERBB4). In addition to hsa-miR-548ba, hsa-miR-548o-3p is expressed in the myometrium, which separately targets the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) pathway.
 Conclusion
 This study reveals that hsa-mir-548 family members are expressed in variable combinations in the reproductive tract, where they potentially fulfil different regulatory roles. The results provide a reference for further studies of the hsa-mir-548 family role in the reproductive tract.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12863-021-00997-w.pdf,"@Article{Rooda2021,

 Studies in patients with dyslipidemia have revealed that, despite guideline recommendations, treatment remains unchanged even when therapeutic goals are not achieved.
 Objective
 Our objective was to determine the degree to which primary care (PC) and specialty care (SC) physicians adhere to clinical guidelines for the management of atherogenic dyslipidemia (AD).
 Methods
 This was an observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study. Physicians working in the Spanish Health System completed an electronic questionnaire comprising 24 items organized into three blocks: clinical guidelines, adherence to clinical guidelines, and other issues in the management of AD. The questions were formulated with closed polytomous or categorized responses. Adherence to guidelines, in terms of treatment, was assessed according to physiciansâ€™ responses to six patient profiles. Absolute and relative frequencies (qualitative variables), central tendency and dispersion (quantitative variables) were calculated.
 Results
 In total, 980 physicians (88.5% PC) participated in the study; 77.3% used guidelines in their routine clinical practice, with the most used being the Spanish SEMERGEN (73.8%) and the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines (41.2%). A total of 83% adhered to guideline recommendations in more than four of the six profiles proposed, 26.2% adhered to the SEMERGEN definition of AD, 66.6% combined all lipoprotein ratios to diagnose AD, andâ€‰>â€‰60% used non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) to diagnose patients with AD at high cardiovascular risk. In total, 99.0% prescribed a fibrate to reduce triglyceride levels, 47.4% to increase HDL-C levels and 40.2% to reduce small, dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol particles.
 Conclusion
 Since adherence to clinical guidelines improves both the quality of care and health outcomes, greater adherence to and satisfaction with clinical guidelines for the management of AD may contribute to improvements in and optimization of the management of patients with AD in the Spanish health system.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40267-019-00605-z.pdf,"@Article{N√∫√±ez-Cort√©s2019,

Prior work on incident management has heavily focused on the challenges with incident triaging and de-duplication. In this work, we address the fundamental problem of structured knowledge extraction from service incidents. We have built SoftNER, a framework for mining Knowledge Graphs from incident reports. First, we build a novel multi-task learning based BiLSTM-CRF model which leverages not just the semantic context but also the data-types for extracting factual information in the form of named entities. Next, we present an approach to mine relations between the named entities for automatically constructing knowledge graphs. We have deployed SoftNER at Microsoft, a major cloud service provider and have evaluated it on more than 2 months of cloud incidents. We show that SoftNERâ€™s unsupervised pipeline learns the software entity types from unstructured incident data with high precision of 0.96 (at rank 50) and 0.77 (at rank 100). We also evaluate and show that SoftNERâ€™s unsupervised pipeline accurately labels data with a precision of 0.94. Further, our multi-task learning based deep learning model also outperforms the state-of-the-art NER models with an average F1 of 0.96.

 The vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery is one of the most important problems in the context of global urban population growth. Although these kinds of small-size problems can be solved using various classical approaches, a fast (or real-time) route optimizer under real-world constraints (such as throughput and time window constraints) for medium- and large-size problems is still a challenge. In this work, we first successfully applied a deep reinforcement learning approach (a modified JAMPR model) to solve the capacitated pickup and delivery problem with time windows (CPDPTW).

However, it is highly challenging to automate and operationalize ML products and thus many ML endeavors fail to deliver on their expectations. The paradigm of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) addresses this issue. MLOps includes several aspects, such as best practices, sets of concepts, and development culture. However, MLOps is still a vague term and its consequences for researchers and professionals are ambiguous. To address this gap, we conduct mixed-method research, including a literature review, a tool review, and expert interviews. As a result of these investigations, we contribute to the body of knowledge by providing an aggregated overview of the necessary principles, components, and roles, as well as the associated architecture and workflows.

WoS,Towards a Risk-Based Continuous Auditing-Based Certification for Machine Learning,,0,"Knoblauch, D and Grossmann, J",,Article,"Machine learning systems have gained widespread adoption across various industries. This includes highly regulated ones that need to match certain quality requirements based on a given risk exposure. The MLOps paradigm, following a similar approach to DevOps, promises major improvements in quality and speed, with a focus on deploying ML models at a fast pace with high quality on an automated basis. However, traditional point-in-time certifications with manual audits are inadequate for MLOps setups due to frequent changes to the ML system. To overcome this challenge, we propose Continuous Audit-Based Certification (CABC), which uses automated audits to issue or revoke certificates based on an automated assessment of artifacts from the MLOps lifecycle. Our approach utilizes artifacts from the MLOps lifecycle for quality measurements based on standards such as ISO 25012. We propose a risk-based measurement selection, an audit API for standardized retrieval of data for measurement, a tamper-proof data collection process, and an architecture for separation of duties in the certification process. CABC aims to improve efficiency, enhance trust in the ML system, and support highly regulated industries in achieving their quality goals.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12626-023-00148-w.pdf,,10.1109/ICSA-C54293.2022.00036,No,

The third focuses on the training process of the machine learning (ML) model using the hyperparameter values estimated in the previous stage, and its evaluation is performed on the testing data by implementing the Neptune AI. The main technologies used to develop a stable and reusable machine learning pipeline are the popular Git version control system, the Google cloud virtual machine, the Jenkins server, the Docker containerization technology, and the Ngrok reverse proxy tool. The latter can securely publish the local Jenkins address as public through the internet. As such, some parts of the proposed pipeline are taken from the thematic area of machine learning operations (MLOps), resulting in a hybrid software scheme.

We propose FedOps, federated learning operations for constructing systematic FL project by enhancing machine learning operations (MLOps) to be effectively applied to FL while preserving its core process. To address complexity of FL implementation, we developed FedOps platform, which involves FedOps-based projects to manage the whole lifecycle in FL context. We also investigated methods to identify performance degradation factors in FL and suggest an approach for improvement. FedOps Platform provides an analysis tool for client heterogeneity, called chunk-bench. This tool enables researchers and engineers to gain insights into systems heterogeneity by using only small chunk of the clients' data to execute test in the shortest time possible while tracking the systems heterogeneity across the clients. By addressing systems heterogeneity, FedOps Platform achieved 13%-43% improvement in communication cost-to-accuracy and 20%-68% improvement in time-to-accuracy. We believe that FedOps Platform offers an optimal solution for end-to-end development of FL projects, with significantly improving both computational and communication efficiencies.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10380563,"@ARTICLE{10380563,

WoS,Continuous Software Engineering Practices in AI/ML Development Past the Narrow Lens of MLOps: Adoption Challenges,,0,"Vänskä, S (Vanska, Sini) ; Kemell, KK (Kemell, Kai-Kristian) ; Mikkonen, T (Mikkonen, Tommi) ; Abrahamsson, P (Abrahamsson, Pekka)",,Article,"Background: Continuous software engineering practices are currently considered state of the art in Software Engineering (SE). Recently, this interest in continuous SE has extended to ML system development as well, primarily through MLOps.

Aim: In this paper, we explored continuous SE in ML development more generally, outside the specific scope of MLOps. We sought to understand what challenges organizations face in adopting all the 13 continuous SE practices identified in existing literature. Method: We conducted a multiple case study of organizations developing ML systems. Data from the cases was collected through thematic interviews. The interview instrument focused on different aspects of continuous SE, as well as the use of relevant tools and methods. Results: We interviewed 8 ML experts from different organizations. Based on the data, we identified various challenges associated with the adoption of continuous SE practices in ML development. Our results are summarized through 7 key findings.

WoS,Clinical deployment environments: Five pillars of translational machine learning for health,,3,"Harris, S ; Bonnici, T ; Swanepoel, N",,Review,"Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) has demonstrated efficacy in computer imaging and other self-contained digital workflows, but has failed to substantially impact routine clinical care. This is no longer because of poor adoption of Electronic Health Records Systems (EHRS), but because ML4H needs an infrastructure for development, deployment and evaluation within the healthcare institution. In this paper, we propose a design pattern called a Clinical Deployment Environment (CDE). We sketch the five pillars of the CDE: (1) real world development supported by live data where ML4H teams can iteratively build and test at the bedside (2) an ML-Ops platform that brings the rigour and standards of continuous deployment to ML4H (3) design and supervision by those with expertise in AI safety (4) the methods of implementation science that enable the algorithmic insights to influence the behaviour of clinicians and patients and (5) continuous evaluation that uses randomisation to avoid bias but in an agile manner. The CDE is intended to answer the same requirements that bio-medicine articulated in establishing the translational medicine domain. It envisions a transition from ""real-world"" data to ""real-world"" development.",https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/digital-health/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2022.939292/pdf?isPublishedV2=false,,10.1109/ICSA-C54293.2022.00052,No,
